"Singapore primed to be the new hotspot for SPAC IPOs SPACS accounted for over 75% of total SGX listings.The Lion City is likely to emerge as the new hotspot for special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) initial public offerings (IPOs), according to the latest report by GlobalData.In the Singapore Exchange (SGX), around 75% of the total listings and 98% of total capital raised during January 22 were made up of SPACs or blank-check companies. Three SPAC IPOs—Vertex Technology Acquisition Corp (VTAC), Pegasus Asia (Pegasus), and Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition (Novo Tellus)—were also introduced by SGX. The three raised $520m during the month. All these three IPOs were subscribed seven to 36 times, which, according to GlobalData, reflects a strong investor sentiment. According to the GlobalData: ""SPAC is a quicker and more economical way for a company to go public. It is a shell company with no revenue-generating business and no prior operating history. It is necessary for a SPAC to announce the combination with a target operating company, referred to as a ‘de-SPAC’ transaction’, within 24 months of IPO listing and complete the transaction within 36 months.""“The emergence of SPAC IPOs in Singapore follows the implementation of new rules in September 2021 that enable blank-check companies to list on SGX’s mainboard. During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, blank-check companies (SPACs) remained one of the [favourite] forms of fundraising in the US. This also led to an increase in interest in SPACs in Asia, with Singapore and Hong Kong relaxing rules to allow blank-check companies to get listed on the mainboards of bourses,” said Keshav Kumar Jha, Business Fundamentals Analyst, GlobalData.",0.12998729944229126,0.01572982594370842,0.8542829155921936

We look forward to the successful introduction of DRs under the DR Linkage, and will continue to work closely with SEC Thailand to further enhance mutual connectivity and broaden investment selections for our investors.”Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, SEC Thailand Secretary-General, also highlighted the amendments undertaken the facilitate this collaboration.“To promote the development of cross-border products, SEC Thailand has put considerable efforts to revise rules and regulations related to DR issuance in Thailand, which entered into force on 16 June 2021. These amendments help to enhance flexibility for DR issuers and to increase investment options for investors. This initial collaboration between SGX and SET is a welcome addition to Thailand and Singapore cross-border development. SEC Thailand looks forward to the successful implementation and participation from market stakeholders. Meanwhile, we will continue to explore further collaborations with MAS in order to advance our capital markets development in the future.”",0.8285477161407471,0.0073738107457757,0.1640785187482834

"SPAC to attract more unicorns, tech players to list in SGX: EY Thanks to Singapore introducing guidelines for SPAC listings.According to a report by Ernst & Young (EY), the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is expected to attract new unicorns and technology players to list at the Singapore Exchange.This will follow Singapore's move to introduce guidelines for SPAC listings, together with various other funding and support initiatives to boost the listing market, said Max Loh, Singapore managing partner and ASEAN IPO leader at EY.In the third quarter, the Asia Pacific region registered a steady initial public offerings (IPO) performance, continuing the strong showing in the first half. It raised 750 IPOs translating to US$123.4b proceeds. Technology is the most active sector in the region by both deal numbers—154 IPOs out of the 750—and proceeds, US$34.3b.Greater China continued to see gains year-to-date, with 444 IPOs raising $127.75b (US$94.1b), a 13% and 20% increase compared to the previous quarter. However, the market experienced a halt of cross-border IPOs from the US market.Japan, meanwhile, had a similar increase with 50% in IPOs at 81 and an increase by 195% in proceeds at $5.43b (US$4b). The strong performance was due to the high liquidity, local stock market performance and overall improvement in sentiment due to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.In terms of exchanges, ASEAN remained steady, with 35 deals raising $4.61 (US$3.4b). The Indonesia Stock Exchange showed the most activity with 15 deals at $2.30b (US$ 1.7b) proceeds; followed by Thailand, nine deals at $520.04 (US$383m). Malaysia and the Philippines had seven deals raising $525.53 (US$387m) and three deals raising $1.34b (US$925m), respectively.“This reinforces the point that ASEAN corporates, in particular technology companies, continue to drive growth and seek capital to fund their growth aspirations. ASEAN exchanges are undergoing regulatory reform to attract and accommodate the listings of their homegrown companies on the domestic exchanges,” Loh said.According to Loh, however, there are signs of a temporary falloff in terms of IPO numbers and proceeds raised after many quarters of robust IPO activity. ""Some of the factors include geopolitical tensions between the US and China, the resurging COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory action across the region, which may stymie growth.""",0.9474695920944214,0.02556742914021015,0.02696303278207779

"Temasek, GIC poised to provide fresh funds to Singapore’s domestic stocks The Monetary Authority of Singapore is also slated to join the efforts. Temasek Holdings and GIC are slated to aid in the boosting of Singapore’s local stock market, according to a Bloomberg report.Temasek Holdings’ 65 Equity Partners Holdings is expected to invest in Singapore and regional mid-cap firms with a fund size of at least $1b. Initial public offerings are also covered by this fund. These companies will be persuaded to use the new framework for blank-cheque companies. This, in turn, will encourage the listing of tech companies in their portfolios. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is also expected to join their actions, with the regulator planning to add to its existing measure, a source disclosed to Bloomberg.In the past years, Singapore’s local bourse has shown signs of struggling, which can be attributed to tepid listings and low liquidity. The low presence of tech names has also affected interest in Singapore’s capital markets, as these have held status as one of the themes in global equity markets.Singapore Exchange’s move to present rules for the listing of SPACs is an attempt to control a worldwide phenomenon, as it is expected to attract listings from various industries.Currently, Temasek’s $381b portfolio contains 24% of local investments. These, however, are directed towards companies like Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecommunications.In a response to Bloomberg queries, Temasek sees this as an opportunity to present opportunities for innovation. “Temasek and its network of partners can be providers of catalytic capital, particularly in the areas of the longer-term structural trends we have identified: digitisation, sustainable living, longer life spans and the future of consumption,” Temasek said.The Ministry of Trade and Industry, MAS, GIC, and Singapore Exchange all declined to comment. According to Bloomberg sources, Temasek’s Tan Chong Lee is aiming to help lead 65 Equity Partners, with plans to go beyond  Singapore when needed. This company, as well as its UK entity, 65 Equity Partners Management, were established this year, as proven by regulatory filings in Singapore and the UK. Meanwhile, GIC has an estimated $731.97b (US$545b) in assets under management, as taken from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Its mandate has stopped it from investing domestically, with exceptions where revenue is generated outside Singapore, such as GLP and Esco Lifesciences Group.",0.16464529931545258,0.03091641142964363,0.8044382333755493

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has recently announced its framework for special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listings on its platform.This makes it the first major Asian exchange to allow SPAC listings.Here are the eight key criteria that SPACs must meet in order to become SGX-listed, as shared by an RHB report:A minimum market capitalisation of $150m;De-SPAC must take place within 24 months of the initial public offering (IPO) (The SGX allows an extension of up to 12 months, subject to conditions);Moratorium on sponsor’s shares from IPO to de-SPAC, a 6-month moratorium after de-SPAC and for applicable resulting insurers, a further 6-month moratorium thereafter on 50% of shareholdings;Sponsors must subscribe to at least 2.5% to 3.5% of the IPO shares/units/warrants depending on the market capitalisation of the SPAC;Approval of more than 50% of the independent directors of the transaction, along with support from more than 50% of the shareholders.Warrants issued to shareholders will be detachable and maximum percentage dilution to shareholders arising from the conversion of warrants issued at IPO is capped at 50%;All independent shareholders are entitled to redemption rights; andSponsor’s promote limit of up to 20% of issued shares at IPO.The SGX will work with the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) on educating potential investors on this new process.In a Reuters report, JPMorgan co-head of Souteheast Asia investment banking, Vineet Mishra, said that fast-growing companies would now have access to markets previously reachable only to larger, established companies. “Companies in the real estate, consumer and infrastructure space have traditionally fuelled the growth in Singapore's capital markets. By expanding the products' range to include SPACs, there might be the opportunity for fast-growing companies to also access these markets,” Mishra said. Hong Kong and Indonesia are also currently mulling SPAC listings on their respective stock exchanges.",0.12647688388824463,0.010265582241117954,0.8632574677467346

"SATS narrows losses amidst strong cargo demand boost The company recorded a 54% YoY revenue fall to $251m.SATS’ revenue for Q3 FY 2021 fell 54% YoY to $251m, whilst its profit after tax and minority interests (PATMI) loss narrowed to $2.8m in the same period due to an uptick in air cargo volumes, government relief, and improved contribution from overseas entities.This result came within the expectations of OCBC Investment Research (OIR) as cargo remained the bright spot amidst a muted travel demand.

"Look beyond CapitaLand's FY2020 headline figures: analysts OCBC Investment Research and RHB gave a 'buy' recommendation for CapitaLand.CapitaLand Limited has reported a $1.57b net loss for FY 2020, due mainly to the revaluation of investment properties and impairments of projects and equity investments.Operating profit after tax and minority interests (PATMI) for FY2020 fell 27.2% YoY to $769.9m. Revenue for the same period rose 4.8% YoY to $6.5b.Despite jarring headline figures, analysts noted to look beyond this and into the recovery of the group.According to RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan, the management highlighted that the revaluations or impairments were focused on a few of its key assets. Five retail assets accounted for slightly more than half of revaluation losses, and three assets accounted for about 80% of impairments.“CapitaLand continues to pivot its assets towards new economy sectors and growing fund management business provides earnings resilience and a platform for recycling capital,” Natarajan said.RHB expects a 27% jump in net profits in FY2021, driven by the absence of rent rebates and better performance from its lodging and retail portfolio.It has maintained its “buy” recommendation for CapitaLand with a target price of $3.75.Meanwhile, OCBC Investment Research (OIR) noted that CapitaLand’s competitive advantage is its significant asset base and extensive market network, which has been further boosted following the completion of the Ascendas-Singbridge merger.CapitaLand has posted a dividend per share (DPS) of 9 Singapore cents per share in FY2020, a 25% decline from the previous year.The OIR research team believes that the lower dividends was a result of the management electing to be more prudent given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, whilst this could also be a strategic move to preserve liquidity to capitalise on future growth opportunities.“Although the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted CapitaLand’s operations, we believe its strong balance sheet and diversified portfolio puts it in a better position to drive a recovery ahead, whilst capital recycling activities are also expected to resume in a more meaningful way,” the team said.OIR has also given CapitaLand a “buy” recommendation with a fair value of $3.79.",0.8211832642555237,0.15545779466629028,0.02335897833108902

"Reduced MSCI offerings could slam SGX's FY2022 earnings: analyst Futures movement may move to its rival in Hong Kong.Singapore Exchange has made a dent on its medium-term thesis after it announced that its license agreement for MSCI ex-Singapore products will expire in February 2021, where its impact to the bourse’s earnings may likely spill over to 2022, according to an analyst note by DBS Group Research.The report noted that Ex-MSCI Singapore products contributed 15% of equity derivatives contracts volume and 12% of total derivatives contracts volumes.Amongst these volumes, MSCI Taiwan contracts, as one of SGX’s top four traded equity contracts, contributed 12% and 10% of equity and total derivatives contracts volumes, respectively. MSCI Singapore products contributed another 5% to total derivatives contractsvolumes.“According to management, there is a ‘potential 10-15% impact on FY2021 NPAT’ based on its estimates, assuming that there will be zero trades in all other MSCI products from July 2020,” said Rui Wen Lim, analyst as DBS Group Research. “We believe that FY2022 is likely to be the worst hit.”However, Lim added that there could be a smaller-than-expected decline in FY2021 as the management has stressed that its assessment is conservative at this point, as some contracts are still likely to trade between July 2020 and February 2021. It also excludes cost and technology expenses associated with the contracts.“We have cut FY21-22F earnings by 11-19% but left FY20F estimates unchanged. There may be potential upside in FY21F estimates should trading continue from July 2020 to February 2021 in the interim as investors mitigate the changes,” Lim stated.Competition intensifiesMeanwhile, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has entered into a major licensing agreement with MSCI, introducing 37 futures and options contracts.“We note that on top of plans to offer MSCI Taiwan products, MSCI Singapore contracts are in the plans as they are not exclusive to SGX and there might be some movement in volumes from SGX to HKEX,” Lee warned.Further, he added that HKEX announced in March 2019 that it was planning to launch futures contracts, which may compete with SGX’s FTSE China A50 Index Futures. The latter accounts for c.40% of SGX’s total derivatives volume.Such a move will likely bolster HKEX’s ambitions in the derivatives space, an area it has been keen to grow in. “The reduction of licence agreement with MSCI has derailed SGX’s medium-term thesis in the interim, which has been powered by derivatives’ growth,” Lee noted.As a result, SGX continues to build on its multi-asset solutions as it believes margin efficiencies across various asset classes will continue to allow it to seek growth in the derivatives business, Lee said. The local bourse stated that they will continue to engage with its stakeholders to manage their open interest as SGX gradually discontinues the relevant MSCI products.“In our view, it could be difficult for SGX to recreate similar products to its existing MSCI offerings. However, SGX has reiterated its continued push to broaden and deepen Asia coverage by developing more derivative products on its own or seeking collaboration with other partners,” Lee added.",0.03830327093601227,0.9243280291557312,0.037368662655353546

Further, Temasek has also agreed to enter into the sub-underwriting agreement with DBS Bank for the remaining $0.6b of SCM rights shares.If any one of the resolutions proposed at the SCI EGM or the SCM EGM is not approved, SCI would retain its current shareholding in SCM, the latter’s $1.5b subordinated loan owing to SCI will remain outstanding, and the critical need to address SCM’s liquidity requirements will not be met.“If that were to happen, SCM’s strenuous efforts to recapitalise and strengthen its balance sheet will be negated and the critical need to address its liquidity requirements will fail. In such a scenario, SCI remains committed to enhancing shareholder value, and will continue to focus on serving the best interests of SCI Shareholders as we explore other options and alternatives going forward,” SCI responded.Sembmarine added, if ever they failed to gain shareholder approval, that the various capital raising alternatives considered include debt financing, equity-linked debt and equity issuance. However, the availability, timing and transaction execution risks of the potential alternative sources of funding mentioned above are uncertain, the firm noted.“Faced with the urgency of the situation to recapitalise SCM, the rights issue is the most optimal solution and is in the best interests of shareholders. The rights issue has the support of both SCM’s parent company, SCI, which has undertaken to subscribe for up to $1.5b of rights shares under the rights issue, and its ultimate holding company, Temasek, which has sub-underwritten the balance $0.6bn of rights shares under the rights issue,” Sembmarine stated.In addition, if the transaction fails, Sembmarine said that they will remain a subsidiary of SCI. They further noted that only a few of their bank facilities will be affected by a change in control.“We have since contacted the banks. They are supportive of the transaction and have indicated the continuation of bank facilities extended to SCM,” Sembmarine said.For the transaction to proceed, SCI explained that there are in total three resolutions that need to be approved for the proposed distribution and the proposed SCM rights issue.For SCI, only one resolution will be tabled: an ordinary resolution to approve the proposed distribution. The resolution requires the approval of a simple majority (>50%) of SCI shareholders who are voting at the SCI EGM, whilst Temasek will abstain from voting on this resolution.For SCM, two resolutions will be tabled: an ordinary resolution to approve the proposed SCM rights issue and a whitewash resolution with respect to the proposed distribution. Both resolutions require the approval of a simple majority (>50%) of SCM Shareholders who are voting at the SCM EGM, where Temasek will also abstain from voting in on the whitewash resolution.SCI also noted that the three resolutions are inter-conditional.Following the demerger, SCI pledged to focus on unlocking value for shareholders, executing their transformation plan to create long-term value for our stakeholders.“The rights issue will provide SCM with the much needed recapitalisation to ride out the industry downturn, to strengthen its balance sheet and reposition the company for its long term viability.

"Singapore unveils transition roadmap for new interest rate benchmark SORA will replace the current key benchmark by end-2021.The government has introduced its new interest rate benchmark for the SGD cash and derivatives market, dubbed as the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA), an announcement revealed.Managed by the Steering Committee for SOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS), SORA will replace the current key benchmark SOR after London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) retires by end-2021.The move was set out together with its response to feedback received from its consultation report released by the Association of Banks and Singapore Foreign Exchange Markets Committee (ABS-SFEMC) on 30 August 2019.“To this end, its work in the next few months will be focused on readying market conventions and infrastructure, building liquidity in SORA markets, engaging early adopters on pilot productstructures for SORA usage in the cash markets, and helping customers’ transition legacy contracts,” said Samuel Tsien, ABS and SC-STS Chairman.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will explore the publication of SORA averages for various tenors and/or a SORA index by H2 2020, as stated in the consultation paper.SC-STS also stated that they will publish guidance on the use of compounded SORA rates in various cash market products in 3Q 2020, as well as a customer segmentation study to identify the types of products and market segments that could benefit from the use of compounded SORA rates.They also plan to provide industry guidance on the appropriate approach for cash market fallbacks to market participants by mid-2020, which include bonds and business loans.Overall, SC-STS noted that there was broad support for SORA to replace SOR. Respondents acknowledged that the move from SOR to SORA was aligned with the global transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to overnight risk-free rates (RFR).",0.19267839193344116,0.01097144652158022,0.7963501811027527

"SGX RegCo warns against reporting earnings before coronavirus Its use was found to be unreliable and misleading.The Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) cautioned issuers against the use of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation and coronavirus (EBITDAC) in presenting their financial performance, the regulator said in a column.SGX RegCo said that the use of such alternative performance measures (APMs) attempts to recast earnings as if the effects of the pandemic had not occurred. “Such hypothetical APMs are unreliable and present a misleading picture of financial performance to investors,” it said.A separate press release from Fitch Ratings noted that a growing number of corporates have been presenting their 2020 interim results using EBITDAC, as companies affected by the pandemic have sought to flatter their results by excluding its impact on their earnings.The agency also found such measures to be unreliable and open to manipulation, as it is difficult to accurately determine the impact of various factors, whether the pandemic or competition and secular industry trends, on their performances.Meanwhile, SGX RegCo noted that APMs, such as EBIT, EBITDA and free cash flows, can be useful to investors when they provide additional insight into the financial performance and condition of issuers, and are often used to supplement information that are provided under relevant accounting standards.“APMs, if used, should be presented consistently between periods with clear explanations on how they are calculated. Issuers must ensure that the APMs do not mislead investors and in particular, should not be used to present a more favourable view or to avoid presenting a less favourable view of the issuer’s performance,” the regulator said.SGX RegCo released a column that aimed to emphasise immediate disclosure by issuers on the material developments brought about by the pandemic. Issuers are also expected to ramp up the scrutiny of high-risk areas such as cash balances and accounts receivables and other areas that require significant estimates like impairment.",0.04348434507846832,0.4158044159412384,0.5407112836837769

CDP Depositors may continue to trade their shares on the SGX-ST until the last day of trading, which is tentatively 11 November.To facilitate the process of the transfer of shares from CDP to CCASS, the firm intends to assist CDP depositors who currently do not have a trading account with a broker; and/or may be unsure as to how to open a trading account which will allow them to commence the share transfer process.

Each venue must have less than 250 people inside, and seats must be placed at least one metre apart from one another, in line with the advisories published by the Ministry of Health.Issuers should also provide advance notice to shareholders to inform them on the number of attendees to be accommodated at each venue. They may also consider doing a pre-registration for shareholders or their proxies to have a better knowledge of those who wish to attend the meeting in person.Should there be 250 or more people attending the meeting, or constraints are likely in the organization of the venue, shareholders should be provided with alternative arrangements to participate in the meeting, added SGX RegCo.Alternative arrangements suggested include holding a simultaneous webcast, having shareholders submit any questions they may have in advance, or holding virtual information sessions before the AGM for shareholders to engage with the management and the board of directors. Issuers must be informed of the alternative arrangements in advance.Shareholders may appoint a chairman for the general meeting that will act as proxy and direct the vote during the meeting.Issuers should publish minutes of the general meetings on its website including its responses from the board and management to substantial queries and relevant comments from shareholders.Further, issuers are required to implement temperature and health screening measures to ensure the health and safety of attendees.

Demand to risk-manage Emerging Asia currencies sustained growth, whilst disruptions in global supply chains continued to drive trading in commodity derivatives.Equity index futures’ traded volume on SGX fell 25% YoY in April to 12.3 million contracts. This was connected to the anticipated gradual reopening of the Chinese economy and optimism for more economic stimulus, both of which helped ease portfolio-hedging activity, noted SGX.

"Total company dividends to drop 4.5% in 2020 UOB is expected to suspend its special dividend for 2020.Singapore companies are expected to post $20.14b (US$14.2b) in dividends for 2020, a 4.5% YoY fall compared to the $21b (US$14.8b) recorded last year, according to IHS Markit’s 2020 APAC dividends report. This results from the circuit breaker measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn is projected to trigger a shrinkage of the gross domestic product (GDP) by more than 4% this year.Also read: Lower dividends on the horizon for banks' shareholders: analystContributing 38.9% of total dividends in the Singapore market, the trio of banking stocks—OCBC, DBS, and UOB— play a decisive role in the trajectory of the overall level of payments from the market, the report noted.Total dividends from the big three bank stocks—OCBC, DBS, and UOB—are expected to decline moderately by 3.1% to $7.66b (US$5.4b). These three stocks contribute 38.9% of total dividends in the market, and thus play a decisive role in the trajectory of the overall level of payments, the report noted.The adverse impacts from COVID-19 have already taken a bite out of banks’ earnings, as reflected by their recently announced Q1 results.UOB, for example, reported a 19% YoY decrease in net profit due to the surge in impairment charges resulting from COVID-19 fallout. Due to the bank’s downbeat earnings outlook, IHS Markit expects UOB to suspend its special dividend in 2020, which has been consistently $0.2 historically.In contrast, DBS paid out a flat Q1 dividend despite a 29% YoY decline in net profit. Even so, the full picture of banks’ dividends payment going forward remains uncertain if the pandemic lingers, noted IHS Markit.The real estate sector is not expected to be spared by the unprecedented disruptions from the pandemic. Total distribution is projected to decrease by 6.1% YoY from $3.83b (US$2.7b) in 2019 to $3.55b (US$2.5b) this year.“We expect real estate investment trusts’ cash flow to be negatively impacted by the rental rebates and deferral offered to tenants. Additionally, the 12-month extension of distribution granted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore also brings more uncertainty in the timing of payment,” the report noted.“Recently, CapitaLand Mall Trust slashed its Q1 distribution by 70.5% and paid out $0.085 to conserve cash; Mapletree Commercial Trust declared a DPU at $0.091 for Q4 2020, decreasing from $0.231 one year ago. The set of results might only be a glimpse of more hit to come,” IHS Markit added.Overall, the country faces significant dividend key date movements in 2020, with the cancellation and deferment of mass gatherings, which in turn forced annual general meetings (AGMs) to be deferred to a further date or done online. Although some of the AGMs dates remain unconfirmed, more companies are expected to bring their AGM dates forward, concluded IHS Markit.",0.011159633286297321,0.9704316258430481,0.018408725038170815

DLCs on HSI, SimSCI and Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) underlying saw 66-85% of their turnover in the Short DLCs.In SiMSCI, the 7x Short DLC gained 387% between 28 February and 19 March on the back of a 24% decline on the index, which is 16 times the performance of the underlying index. This disproportionate return is due to the positive compounding effect.Compounding occurs when the performance of an underlying asset and DLCs are measured from the intrinsic closing levels recorded the previous day when markets open the next day. This meant that the performance for each day is locked in, and subsequent returns come on top of it.However, following the sharp rebound after 19 March, the compounded return would have eroded to a gain of 56%, less than seven times the performance of the underlying index if held since 28 February.Still, the recent rebound offered opportunities for a swing trade, as the 7x Long SiMSCI DLC gained 116% between 23 March and 27 March, slightly more than seven times the performance of the index’s 14% gain.SGX hosts the trading of 20 DLCs on three developed market indices, namely SiMSCI, HSI and HSCEI, with leverage levels of three, five or seven times.Besides Index DLCs, there are also 76 DLCs on Singapore and Hong Kong stocks, including the three local banks, Venture, Tencent, and Geely Automobile.

Companies with high cash reserves and dividend yields can weather any downturn better than peers,” wrote analyst John Cheong.The number of privatisations rose to 34 in 2019, from 14 in the previous year, attributed to lacklustre valuation, lack of funding requirements, and backing from new partners.

"STI opens with 3% drop over oil mayhem fallout Steep declines in offshore, banking, and property are dragging on the index.Global oil prices tumbled 30% after the OPEC and Russia failed to reach an agreement on production cuts, and no markets were spared from the fallout as Singapore’s Straits Times Index (STI) fell 3% when it opened on 9 March.This latest downturn suggests that oil prices could go as low as US$18 per barrel, according to CMC Markets’ analyst Margaret Yang.“With the market in this freefall, capital preservation will be on top of investors’ minds. Large gap-downs in oil and futures markets may trigger stop-loss orders which reinforces the selloff. We are not yet in a financial crisis but if markets continue to behave in this way, we may end up with one,” Yang said.Already, three sectors in Singapore are feeling the investor jitters: offshore, banking and real estate.

The three have extensively provisioned their oil and gas exposures since the 2015-2016 oil prices collapse, and most vulnerable exposures are already classified as nonperforming,” said Eugene Tarzimanov, Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer.Tarzimanov also added Singapore’s further economic slowdown will force the banks to post higher non-performing loans.Following the figures from today’s open, Singapore stocks are still falling, being 5.38% or 159.38 lower to 2,806.64 points as of 3:06pm. The decline is currently being led by DBS with a 8.44% plunge.Overall, companies’ access to capital are expected to be limited and their free cash flow will be hit as the double whammy from the COVID-19 and oil price war persists into H2.“The only silver lining in a very dark cloud is for refining – the sector will be hit hard by weak demand, but it is at least saved from tightening crude differentials associated with a major cut in OPEC supplies,” commented Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president for macro oils at Wood Mackenzie.Meanwhile, US equity futures equities went down over 3% at Asia’s Monday open with USD/JPY slumping on haven demand.

"Buy Singapore stocks to weather the COVID-19 storm: Morgan Stanley Its defensive market should still be able to provide earnings despite some bad quarters.As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, investors could take shelter on Singapore stocks to guard their wealth against the virus’ impact, Morgan Stanley said in a note.In a note, the bank recommended a defensive stance by reducing beta and active risk, lifting the quality of assets, but remaining open for possible stimulus.Singaporean and Australian stocks were preferred given their traditionally defensive markets.Singapore banks are quite resilient to near-term disruption as dividends will be paid even if there are a couple of bad quarters, placing a floor on the potential downside, noted Morgan Stanley financial analyst Nick Lord.Also read: Coronavirus outbreak to drag on Singapore banks' loan growth and earningsFurther, whilst bank earnings could dip somewhat in 2020, Lord sees a sharp rebound in 2021 although this was yet to be fully priced into current valuations.In terms of local property stocks, home sales growth is expected to be sustained despite near term disruptions, which in turn should support developers’ share prices, according to Morgan Stanley’s ASEAN Property analyst Wilson NgFor REITs, the falling interest rate expectations could be supportive, particularly for segments which are less impacted by COVID-19 such as industrial REITs.Also read: S-REITs hit 2% returns in 2020Morgan Stanley also moved China’s stocks to overweight, as it can deliver positive albeit only single-digit earnings per share (EPS) by Q4 2020 should the outbreak not persist until Q3. This is compared with a third consecutive year of modestly negative EPS for emerging markets (EM), as well as expected negative earnings from Japan.However, the bank lowered their earnings forecasts and targets for China stocks on the basis of a gradual production recovery in the country.“For the China indices, the current pattern of economic impact, initial progress towards production recovery, additional stimulus and a relatively stable CNY profile sees us downgrade earnings by less than for Japan and EM,” the report stated.The bank expressed caution for Korean and Japan stocks, noting their soft Q4 earnings. Amongst the former, Morgan Stanley recommended buying Korean IT stocks, and dropping consumer stocks, including autos.Meanwhile, Japan remains preferred over EM for its better governance as well as profitability trends, but the bank advised seeking better cyclical opportunity later in the year.Morgan Stanley has named three scenarios in the coronavirus outbreak. The first is a full-containment by this month, which projects a recovery in the second half of the year to overturn any declines in H1 2020. The second scenario sees demand and supply-chain disruption extending into Q2 2020, which would drive global growth to dip 2.4% YoY in H1 2020.A third scenario sees the virus persisting into Q3, which escalates global recession risks. The latter would see Japan and Europe slip into a technical recession, whilst Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand are also headed towards negative-growth paths.",0.07041027396917343,0.90460205078125,0.024987617507576942

"282 shareholders to get cold shoulder from LifeBrandz' share consolidation The travel agency firm plans to consolidate 50 existing ordinary shares into one.The 282 individuals who hold less than 50 shares in travel agency firm LifeBrandz will cease to be shareholders of the company upon completion of its proposed share consolidation, according to their response to Singapore Exchange Securities Trading’s (SGX-ST) queries.LifeBrandz announced last January of its share consolidation of every 50 existing ordinary shares in the capital of the firm into one ordinary share. It also plans to raise funds through a renounceable non-underwritten rights issue of up to about 305.84 million new ordinary shares on the basis of 25 rights shares for every one consolidated share.The rights issue is priced at $0.028 apiece, aiming to raise net proceeds of $8.4m.However, SGX-ST also questioned this, recalling that LifeBrandz has just completed a placement exercise in January 2020 to Capital Square and raised $0.42m net proceeds. The travel agency then assured that the proceeds from its placement exercise has been fully utilised and that the purpose of the rights issue is different from the previous fundraiser.“Under the placement exercise, the net cash proceeds of $0.42m raised have been used solely to finance the Group's general working capital and to strengthen the Company's financial position. In contrast, apart from strengthening the Group's financial position, the main purpose of the rights issue is to reduce its existing liabilities, and to finance the expansion of the group's F&B business and new distribution business,” the firm stated in the filing.SGX-ST also asked whether its Board is considering abstaining Bounty Blue’s executive chairman and CEO Saito Hiroyuki from voting at its upcoming extraordinary general meeting (EGM). Bounty Blue holds a 25.36% stake in LifeBrandz.The firm then stated that there is no need for such an action. “[T]he Board took into consideration other rights issues in the market with similar offsetting arrangements of loans or advances made by controlling shareholders who had given undertakings to subscribe for their pro rata entitlements of rights shares (and excess in certain cases). In each scenario, the controlling shareholder did not have to abstain from voting at the general meeting,” LifeBrandz said.",0.08273748308420181,0.023238377645611763,0.894024133682251
"BreadTalk to be delisted from SGX Its major shareholders offered to buy all of its other shares for $0.77 apiece.The major shareholders of bakery chain operator BreadTalk Group will increase its stake in the firm, allowing it to exit from the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading (SGX-ST) as it will fall under its 10% free-float requirement, a bourse filing revealed.Founders George Quek Meng Tong and Katherine Lee Lih Leng and Minor International PCL, have launched a voluntary conditional cash offer to acquire all of its issued ordinary shares for $0.77 apiece. The offer price represents a premium of approximately 19.4%. and 30.1% over the closing price on 21 February and the one-month volume weighted average price, respectively.In addition, each of Quek, Lee, Square Investment (an investment vehicle jointly owned by Quek and Lee) and Primacy Investment Limited (an indirect subsidiary of Minor International) has given an irrevocable undertaking to tender all the shares that they hold in acceptance of the offer and reinvest the consideration due to them to subscribe for new shares.As of 24 February, they collectively own 397,143,308 shares, or about 70.53% of BreadTalk. The filing also mentioned that its businesses are struggling Hong Kong, China and Thailand.“The offer represents an attractive cash exit opportunity for BreadTalk shareholders to realise their entire investment at a premium to the prevailing market prices, without incurring brokerage and other trading costs,” the offeror stated.The offerors also noted that the move will better manage BreadTalk’s business, optimise the use of its management and resources, save on expenses and costs relating to the maintenance of a listed status and channel such resources to its business operations.They also added that BreadTalk has not carried out any exercise to raise equity capital on the SGX-ST in the last 10 years.“BreadTalk is unlikely to require access to Singapore equity capital markets to finance its operations in the foreseeable future as it has various other available funding sources such as bank borrowing facilities,” it stated.“Shareholders would be better off accepting the offer as the valuation is attractive at 33x FY20F PE; we believe shareholders would find it difficult to hold out for a higher offer price and offer is higher than closing prices in the past eight months,” said Alfie Yeo, an analyst at DBS Group Research.He also added that that the shareholding structure of BreadTalk is sporadic, with the second largest shareholder holding only a 4.99% stake based on shareholding structure listed on Bloomberg.“As the second largest shareholder is way smaller, it is difficult for all the minority shareholders to collectively reject the S$0.77 offer to force the offeror to increase the offer price,” Yeo said.At the offer price, BreadTalk’s market cap or equity valuation is at around $434m, which would cost about $130m to take out the remaining c.30% shareholders. Upon completing the deal, the offeror is will have 100% access to the balance sheet of $157.6m cash as of December 2019.“Over the past five years, the business was able to generate operating cash of at least $65m annually. The owners will enjoy full benefit of this cash after privatisation,” Yeo explained. “We believe the deal makes sense for both the offeror and shareholders”.",0.8026832342147827,0.010699176229536533,0.1866176426410675

Companies who raised their interim dividends include OCBC, UOB, JS, and CD.Credit Suisse expects the dismal results to continue as, “the slowing economic growth will likely drive deeper earnings cuts, with potential downside risk to dividends as a result,” the report read.The bank picked transport services company ComfortDelGro (CDG), agribusiness Wilmar International (WIL), and property company UOL Group (UOL) as top picks amongst stocks.

"REITs eyed to boost Singapore's IPO landscape The sector accounted for almost half of the US$36.16b raised since 2009.The pipeline of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Singapore bourse is expected to rebound from the lacklustre performance recorded in 2018 as the real estate investment trusts (REITs), business trust (BTs) and healthcare sectors could help map the bourse’s turnaround story.The 2019 IPO performance YTD has so far been encouraging and exceeding the number of offerings and listing proceeds seen during the same period in 2018, according to Tay Hwee Ling, Deloitte Southeast Asia and Singapore’s global IFRS and offerings services leader.“There have been seven IPOs which raised $1.53b in 2019’s five-month period, which is close to almost triple that of 2018’s five-month performance, and more than six times that of the funds raised during the same period in 2017,” she told Singapore Business Review.Amongst these offerings was an IPO launched by ARA US Hospitality Trust in May, the first listed US hospitality trust on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), which priced its 379.78 million stapled securities at US$0.88 apiece. Its expected proceeds are expected to hit US$498m.This sentiment was shared by Tham Tuck Seng, capital markets leader at PwC Singapore, who added that international investors’ familiarity with the local bourse is expected to boost listing activity in the months to come.“It is the most international exchange amongst the major exchanges in the world. PwC conducted a global survey to ask respondents which exchanges the issuers will consider beyond their home exchange in 2030 for an IPO, and 11% cited the SGX,” he said.That said, he acknowledged that the factors that prompted increased volatility at the end of 2018, and continued caution in 2019, have not disappeared.Singapore was not spared from heightened market volatility after IPO proceeds crashed to $730m across 15 offerings compared to the $4.7b reached across 20 IPOs in 2017, according to PwC’s Equity Capital Markets Watch report. Globally, the IPO market felt the consequences of trade and geopolitical tensions as the number of IPOs decreased from 1,081 to 870 for YTD 30 September.Also read: Singapore IPO proceeds plunge to $730m in 2018“The uncertainty of the trade row between US and China, and its impact on economic growth, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit may drive the IPO market into a cautionary stance. This means investors will still remain more selective,” Tham noted.It is for these reasons, according to Tay, which may have led to Eagle Hospitality REIT’s IPO falling flat despite being the largest Singapore float to date. The firm saw less than half of its stapled securities subscribed under the public offer, prompting joint bookrunners and underwriters to pick up the slack and take up the bulk of the undersubscribed securities.DBS Bank, which acted as the sole financial adviser and issue manager, a joint global coordinator, a joint bookrunner and underwriter for the offering, was allocated 12.64 million stapled securities, followed by joint global coordinator, joint bookrunner and underwriter Merrill Lynch (Singapore) with 4.3 million stapled securities.UBS AG, Singapore Branch and BNP Paribas, acting through its Singapore branch, were each a joint global coordinator, as well as a joint bookrunner and underwriter. Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch, and Jefferies Singapore, were also joint bookrunners and underwriters for the offering. BNP paribas, Deutsche Bank and Jefferies Singapore were each allocated 1.77 million stapled securities.But despite its less than stellar take-up, Eagle Hospitality REIT’s IPO still managed to raise approximately $792m (US$566m), which accounted for more than 50% of the total amount raised in the first five months of 2019 on SGX of $1.53b.According to Tham, REITs and BTs are likely to continue to be the stars of the local bourse. Data from Dealogic noted that REIT IPOs made up 42 out of the overall 230 Singapore-listed offerings over the last 10 years. They also accounted for almost half or US$17.63b of the US$36.16b clinched since 2009.Singapore’s REIT market ranks as the sixth largest in the world and third in Asia with a market cap of US$53b as February 2018, according to boutique real estate fund manager Q Investment Partners. The market value of the S-REIT sector has expanded by more than 200% over the past 10 years, data from SGX Research show.Although S-REITs have trailed behind the benchmark Straits Times Index at the start of 2018, the sector rallied and caught up in Q4 2018 as the Fed assumed a more dovish stance. In November and December 2018, S-REITs were amongst the best-performing sectors in SGX registering total returns of 2.3% and 0.3% respectively, data from SGX show, with most of those gains extending into 2019.Also read: S-REITs hit average total returns of 13.6% in 2019 YTDThe REIT sector was followed by the construction and building industry which saw 33 IPOs and the professional services segment with 18 offerings.Beyond the strong-performing REIT sector, Tham adds that the city could also bank on more healthcare and tech listings over the following months. Tay also observed a variety of interesting sector listings on the SGX including mining, industrial products and a theme park developer.A report from PwC expects SGX to outpace the Johannesburg and Deutsche bourse to rank as the ninth most preferred listing destination by 2030, with 15% of issuers considering the possibility of a Singapore listing eleven years from now, up from the current 11%.“SGX is a market leader… and can be the gateway for issuers to tap on multiple markets outside of the region. For instance, they now have partnerships with NASDAQ and Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, which paves the way for more technology and healthcare companies to dual-list,” Tay said.",0.919036865234375,0.048914700746536255,0.03204849362373352

"Mapletree Logistics Trust could embark on $500m acquisition spree by FY2020 Possible acquisitions could come from China or Vietnam.Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) is expected to seal $500m in new acquisitions in FY 2020 thanks to an active pipeline from its sponsor and a myriad of opportunities from third parties, a report by DBS Equity Research revealed.In July, it was reported that global private equity firm Blackstone acquired a Tokyo warehouse portfolio from MLT’s sponsor for approximately $1.26b (JPY100b). The asset was initially part of the sponsor’s pipeline available for MLT.“However, we understand that such a deal may not have been accretive for MLT,” CGS-CIMB’s analysts Lock Mun Yee and Ervin Seow noted. “MLT continues to have a pipeline of approximately five million sqm of logistics assets from its sponsor, and we think that any possible acquisition could come from China or Vietnam.”Following the successful acquisition of a 50% interest in 11 properties in China and a portfolio of five ramp-up properties in Singapore, as well as the divestments of selected older-specification properties, MLT saw a slight dip in occupancy rates to 97.6% in Q1 FY 2019/2020. “We saw a drop in occupancy rates in Singapore due to the expiry of a single-user asset (SUA) for which the manager looks to backfill in the subsequent quarters,” DBS’ analysts said.Hong Kong and South Korea also saw a QoQ dip in occupancy, down to 97.6% and 98.5% from 98.8% and 99.1%, respectively.A separate report by OCBC Investment Research (OIR) also noted that with the uncertain macroeconomic environment, MLT explained that customers have become more cautious on renewals and capacity expansion. “However, overall leasing demand for warehouse space has been resilient to-date,” OIR’s analysts said.The REIT also reported a strong rental reversion of 1.8% during the quarter, mainly from Hong Kong, Vietnam and China.In Q1, MLT’s net property income (NPI) jumped 18.2% YoY to $106.1m from $89.8m, whilst revenue rose 13.6% YoY to $119.81m from $105.44m, thanks to income growth from its completed redevelopment of Mapletree Ouluo Logistics Park Phase 1, and regional acquisitions in the last fiscal year.Also read: Mapletree Logistics Trust NPI climbed 18.2% to $106.1m in Q1“Contributions from these more than offset the income vacuum left by asset divestments in Q1 FY 2020, two in FY 2019, as well as the impact of the weaker AUD, RMB and Korean Won against the SGD,” DBS’ analysts said. They added that MLT saw higher take-rates of 96.4% in China during the quarter from the backfilling of JD.com space.",0.2290247231721878,0.7444892525672913,0.026486041024327278

On the other hand, stocks of Golden-Agri Resources, Dairy Farm International and ST Engineering were able to weather the downturn as they were able to average a 2.6% decline.November will be marked with a possible rebound, the firm believes.

"Derivatives to account for half of SGX's group revenue in 2019: analyst It’s set to haul $444m in revenue as rattled investors continue to seek risk management solutions.Market volatility and heightened demand for risk management solutions may further boost the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) derivatives business which is set to rack in $444m in revenue in 2019 and make up 50% of SGX's group revenue, according to a report by OCBC Investment Research (OIR).SGX’s derivatives posted the largest increase in revenues of 35% YoY to $112.9m, contributing the most to the local bourse’s earnings for Q2. Equity and commodities revenue also grew 23% as total volumes increased in tandem to 60 million contracts compared to 48.6 million contracts the year before, SGX highlighted in its financial statement.“We achieved a second consecutive quarter of record performance in our derivatives business with robust institutional demand for our risk management and hedging tools, including our MSCI Net Total Return index futures and FX futures contracts,” SGX’s CEO Loh Boon Chye said in a statement.This was echoed by OIR’s report, which cited derivatives as SGX’s ‘star performer’, accounting for 50% of the local bourse’s overall revenue and overtaking its other businesses.SGX’s securities trading and clearing business also saw its revenues dip 13% YoY to $45.2m from $51.8 MAS securities daily average traded value (SDAV) dropped 14% YoY to $980m from $1.14b.Also read: SGX Q2 profits up 9% to $96.5m“As expected, equities and fixed income fell 12.3% YoY to $85.6m, and accounted for about 38% of revenue now versus 48% a year earlier,” OIR analyst Carmen Lee stated in the report. “A Q2 dividend of $0.075 was declared, bringing the H1 dividend payout to $0.15 versus $0.10 a year ago.”Based on management’s full year guidance for operating expenses and H1 total expenses of $213m, this means that operating expenses will go up in H2 to around $232m to $242m, Lee said in the report. “With lingering market concern over the ongoing trade war, cut in economic growth forecasts, and the potential impact on corporate earnings and outlook, volatility and risks will remain this year,” she added.Whilst this may mean bad news for some, SGX can peg its hopes on volatility to further boost its derivatives and overall revenue. ""We are bullish on derivatives volume numbers,"" RHB Research analyst Leng Seng Choon added.

"SGX's securities average daily value fell 7.11% in July to $1.11b The FIFA World Cup has weakened trading volumes.The Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) securities average daily value (SADV) in July 2018 hit $1.11b, 7.11% lower compared to last year possibly due to the FIFA World Cup, RHB Research said.According to a research note, SGX recorded a SADV of $1.24b in FY2018, which is already higher than the brokerage’s expectations of $1.2b and FY2017’s total of $1.12b. “Looking ahead, we are bullish on SADV and have assumed FY2019 SADV of $1.39b,” analyst Leng Seng Choon added.“Global developments, including further hikes in the US Federal (Fed) funds rate (FFR) and trade war concerns, could stimulate more switching of stock holdings in investors’ portfolios and in turn generate trading volume,” Leng said.Meanwhile, the SGX’s derivatives average daily volume (DADV) of 820,000 was 11% lower QoQ but was 14% higher YoY. “The sequentially weaker trend was largely attributed to QoQ weaker trading volumes for the China A50 Index Futures,” Leng said.The analyst expects a similar DADV for FY2019, taking into consideration the “adverse impact” from the trading of Nifty 50 Index Futures – which accounts for 11% of total derivatives traded volume.RHB Research forecasts a net profit growth of 9.7%. “SGX is in a net cash position and has a monopoly over the trading of Singapore equities,” it said.However, it cited key risks such as global economic fluctuations and geopolitical developments. “The outcome of the arbitration between SGX and IISL could also impact future derivatives trading volume and hence earnings,” it added.",0.01968330703675747,0.9572898149490356,0.023026952520012856

"Can Singapore hold firm to its stock market dominance? Halfway through Q1, companies that reported their results gained 9% YoY, whilst FTSE Singapore beat all other 12 indices in Asia.Half of the Straits Index Times (STI) stocks that are scheduled to report earnings this reporting season have now released their results, with average net profit after tax growing 9% YoY, SGX Research data as of 30 April revealed.Meanwhile, the alternate FTSE Singapore Index has maintained the strongest return among the Asia Pacific Indices over the first four months of 2018. The FTSE Singapore Index (with 32 constituents) generated a USD total return of 9.5%.This compared to an average decline of 0.1% for all the 13 Asian Pacific Indices that span 1,000 stocks. Indices and Taiwan and Thailand both gained 8.1%. To compare, in 2017, the FTSE Singapore Index generated a 36.1% USD total return which compared to an average of 31.7% for the 13 Indices.However, CMC Markets sales trader Oriano Lizza told Singapore Business Review that looking forward, there are concerns that Singapore might not be able to maintain that sort of pace. ""It is reliant on the wider geographical performance of Asia and the US as well. I think [companies] are concerned about an economic slowdown,"" he added.Lizza also noted that there are many potential trade tariffs or trade concerns when China and the US meet. This has happened just recently when the STI dropped 2.3% after US president Donald Trump said he would impose US$50b-US$60b tariffs against Chinese goods over intellectual property violations.However, the trader also thinks Singapore has an advantage compared to other markets. ""I think the Singapore market is exposed to an extent, but it’s also somewhat isolated compared to other political and geographical regions,"" he said. ""If we look at, for example, Japan, it is very dependent on imports and exports, but the STI seems to be somewhat more balanced in terms of its constituents. In terms of the Hang Seng, they are being weighed down by the Mainland markets and the slower economy as well.""""With Singapore, they obviously have made some adjustments in the dual listing of the companies, trying to encourage further investment. But as they’re not directly connected to other Asian markets which are slowing down and showing downturn or underperformance, they are actually benefiting from that,"" he added.Moreover, Singapore banks are currently leading growth due to improved trading conditions in the markets they are exposed in. SGX reported that five of the best performing STI stocks in April are composed of two banks and one shipping firm: Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT), DBS Group Holdings, and United Overseas Bank.SGX market strategist Geoff Howie noted that in recent months, banks have been the strongest of the STI Sectors. ""In total, the three banks reported that their FY2017 Net Profit totalled $11.9b with the average Return-on-Equity for FY2017 at 10.4%. In the 2018 year through to 25 April, institutional investors were net buyers of the three banks, with inflows totalling $1.1b, following net inflows of $3.4b in 2017 and a net outflow of $155m in 2016,"" he said.Lizza explained, ""The banking stocks continue to grow YoY as their loan books have increased significantly and they’ve also benefited from the rising income in the commodities market, they’re quite heavily exposed to commodities. Three percent of their loan book is out to big energy players like Keppel and Sembcorp Marine,"" he said. ""The increase in oil prices, energy, and commodities have risen has allowed them to pay loans back. I think they benefit a lot from that.""He added that there is a rising rate environment locally as well as globally. ""Any outstanding debt they’ve got are benefiting from that and also there’ll be inflows from people’s investments looking to yield returns,"" he said.As a result, banks have generated 18% market capitalisation weighted total returns over the first four months of 2018. However, Howie noted that the materials sector (which does not have STI representation) beat the former and returned 20%.""The gain by the comparatively smaller Materials sector has been led by chemical related and industrial metal related plays that are based in China,"" he said. ""Whilst the IT Sector declined 14% in April, it has still maintained a 14% gain for the first four months of 2018. Also, the Healthcare Sector has rebounded somewhat after a somewhat subdued 2017, with 9% gains in the 2018 year through to the end of April,"" he added.""The STI is a highly competitive and diversified benchmark index,"" Howie concluded. ""Just as Singapore has been amongst the strongest advanced economies in recent quarters, the STI has generated comparatively strong gains.""",0.2023368775844574,0.7234068512916565,0.07425621151924133
"Global risks to bolster SGX trading volume Securities average daily value could hit $1.2b in 2018.Global developments could stimulate the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) securities trading volume, RHB Research said. Its analyst Leng Seng Choon noted that during 1 April to 18 June, SGX recorded a securities average daily value (SADV) of $1.26b.“Global developments such as the US Federal (Fed) funds rate (FFR) hikes could stimulate investors to switch their stock holdings and in turn generate stronger trading volumes, in our view,” said Leng. He added that US-China trade tensions could also help drive SADV up.The analyst projected that FY2018 SADV could hit $1.2b, which is close to the forecasted YTD amount of $1.23b. “Looking ahead, we are bullish on SADV, forecasting $1.39b for FY2019,” he said.RHB Research also noted that the impact of the SGX-IISL development could be relatively small. “The May 2018 derivatives average daily contracts (DADC) of 763,000 was weaker than 3QFY2018’s 922,000 but our FY2018 assumption is closer to the May 2018 number,” Leng said.“Our FY2019 DADC assumption of 821,000 factors in an adverse impact from Nifty 50 Index Futures trading – for 3QFY2018, the SGX Nifty 50 Index Futures accounted for 11% of total derivatives traded volume,” the analyst added.In an announcement on 16 June 2018, SGX said that it was granted an extension for its licence to continue listing and trading of SGX Nifty contracts beyond August 2018, as part of the ongoing arbitration proceedings.",0.905738353729248,0.05331489071249962,0.04094686731696129

"Bitcoin's rise to $7,000 shows Singapore needs to get serious about cryptocurrencies After breaching $6,500 for the first time a day earlier, Bitcoin prices surged as high as $7,350 in trading Thursday likely thanks to traders in Asia noticing the CME Group’s announcement.CME Group said earlier this week that it plans to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory review.In Singapore, progress on the cryptocurrency front appears to be keeping up with global demand.Singapore making good progressRegulators here are open to having initial coin offerings (ICOs) sold through a regulatory sandbox, said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), at a recent fintech event.Cryptocurrencies can secure and providing a level of transparency. Transactions in them cannot be faked or reversed and there tend to be low fees, making it more reliable than conventional currency.Their decentralised nature means they are available to everyone, where banks can be exclusive in who they will let open accounts.Such is the opportunity that we see in cryptocurrencies that we are planning to do an ICO through LATTICE80, our Singapore-headquartered fintech hub, in 2018.Whilst we are initially looking to offer to accredited investors only, the requirement of individual clearance prior to investment is optional for firms undertaking an ICO.ICOs as an alternative asset classAs I laid out in my plans last month, we are seeing huge demand and opportunities in ICOs globally. It is changing the demographics of the whole finance industry.We are seeing a clear need to offer a proper infrastructure to support a this new field of cryptoeconomics in Singapore and the region.We would like to build a system where high net worth individuals (HNWIs) and institutions can participate under properly regulated systems and compliance mechanisms.There is an opportunity for ICOs in Singapore to institutionalise this emerging asset class to offer a new alpha opportunity, with lower co-relation to existing assets in alternative asset portfolios, for institutional investors.With correct regulatory frameworks in place, it could be a boon to Singapore’s position as a leading global financial hub.A hard but rewarding balancing actWhilst Singapore doesn't plan to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, it will remain alert to money laundering and other potential risks stemming from their use, the head of the country's central bank said at the end of last month.Amongst companies that have conducted an ICO in Singapore is TenX, which raised US$80 million in June.Bitcoin’s total market capitalisation is now over $110 billion.The value of bitcoin is expected to continue to increase, with some experts believing it will cross the $25,000 threshold within the next five years.Singapore would do well to position itself to be a beneficiary of this growth, whilst not undermining regulatory integrity and consumer confidence and protection.A balancing act that, if it gets right, will be well worth the effort.",0.5315124988555908,0.012025099247694016,0.45646244287490845

"STI dividends could soar 29% to $20.9b in 2018: IHS Markit The banking, telecommunication, and real estate sectors are expected to contribute $13.5b to the total.Companies in the FTSE Straits Times Index are expected to return $20.9b in dividends to shareholders this year, up 29% from $16.2b in 2017, IHS Markit said in a forecast.IHS Markit Dividend Forecasting senior research analyst Chong Jun Wong noted that dividend growth had been lacklustre in recent years due to the collapse in oil prices, as oil and gas companies reduce payouts and banks become conservative with dividends, as a result of the decrease in their bottom line figures.Wong said, “However, dividends announced since the beginning of this year, suggests a turnaround in payouts from the benchmark index. The index now boasts an average forward dividend yield of 3.8% based on our forecasts, the highest compared with other benchmark indices in the region.”The forecast revealed that dividends from STI are anchored by the banking, telecommunication, and real estate sectors. On aggregate, dividends from these sectors are estimated to grow by 30% year-on-year to $13.5b, which represents nearly two-thirds of the projected aggregate dividends in 2018.The banking sector comprises of DBS Group Holdings (DBS), United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), and Wong forecasts these three banks to announce $7.7b in dividends in 2018, translating to an uplift of around 80% from the amount registered a year ago.“Firstly, although the price outlook of oil remains dull due to oversupply concerns, the banks had cleaned up their balance sheet in recent quarters and have recorded the necessary impairments. Management teams asserted that risks from the struggling oil and gas sector are well contained, and this implies that there should not be any unexpected bad debt expenses over the short term, which could cause a drag on its bottom line growth,” Wong said.Also read: It's raining dividends at OCBC and UOB“The banks have - to various degrees - provided some form of dividend guidance for the current year. This highlights the confidence they have in their performance over the short term,” he added.Meanwhile, real estate companies are expected to deliver dividends of $2.6b, which represents an uplift of around 7.1% from the dividends declared in 2017. Property developers account for around 55% of aggregate dividends from the sector, and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) account for the remaining 45%.Wong noted that property developers, that is Capitaland Limited (CapitaLand), City Developments Limited (City Developments), Hongkong Land Holdings (HK Land) and UOL Group Limited (UOL), have consistently paid out flat or higher dividends in recent years. “This phenomenon is supported by their aim to derive a significant component of their earnings from their investment properties, which are recurring in nature and provide some visibility to bottom line figures.”On the downside, aggregate dividends from the telecommunication sector are expected to fall in 2018 due to the absence of the one-off special dividend from Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel) in 2017.Wong said payouts are projected to be relatively flat in short-term, weighed on by intense intra-industry competition. “Competition is harsh in the Singapore telecommunications sector. Notably, the decrease in revenue experienced over the past year from the mobile services segment suggests that companies have been undercutting prices to retain and attract customers,” he added.",0.8769450187683105,0.09265751391649246,0.030397456139326096

"Total funds raised via IPO skyrocketed to a four-year high Amount doubled to $4.7b versus 2016's $2.3m.The year 2017 ended with a good showing for the Singapore Exchange (SGX), with total funds raised through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) being the highest in the past four years. PwC’s Equity Capital Markets Watch found that total funds raised in 2017 amounted to S$4.7 billion, double that of 2016 at approximately S$2.3 million.The SGX saw a total of 20 IPOs with seven listings on the Mainboard and 13 listings on the Catalist Board in 2017. SGX also welcomed the listing of NetLink NBN Trust, which raised approximately S$2.4 billion in gross proceeds, making it the largest IPO listing that the Singapore equity capital market has seen in six years.Tham Tuck Seng, Capital Markets Leader at PwC Singapore, said, “The year 2017 has been a brilliant one for IPOs in Singapore. With the market upturn, we see that Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and business trusts (BTs) continue to dominate the market making up 88% of total funds raised.”Last year (2017) saw a total of 30 follow-ons (FO), which raised a combined gross proceeds of approximately S$3.0 billion. FO performance in Singapore for 2017 was dominated by REITs and BTs, accounting for 81% of total FO funds raised the entire year. A total of 12 REITs and BTs from this sector engaged in FO activities in 2017, an increase from 2016 which saw 10 REITs and BTs engaged in FO activities.Most of the funds raised by these REITs and BTs are expected to be used for the acquisition of new assets and the repayment of existing borrowings. In addition, rising interest rates are also causing debt financing to become increasingly expensive. It is therefore not surprising that real estate players are tapping on the equity market to finance new acquisitions and pare down their borrowings level.",0.17485958337783813,0.7525591254234314,0.07258129864931107
"Hong Kong and Singapore bourse bosses lock horns over listings SFC executive Ashley Alder called out an SGX executive’s comments on their performance.Hong Kong and Singapore’s long-running rivalry got more heated than usual.According to Bloomberg, a Singapore Exchange (SGX) executive reportedly suggested that China’s government has “some influence” over Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) during a marketing trip to Hong Kong last week.In a public forum, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder remarked, “We don’t normally as an organization dignify remarks made by competitors with a response, but I thought today I’d make an exception to that rule.” Alder added that Hong Kong has an “arms-length” relationship with policy makers in Beijing and any suggestion that the SFC is “under the influence” is “totally false.”“I don’t think it was very adult,” Alder said of the executive’s comment.The episode highlighted the growing intensity of a battle for stock-market listings between the two financial hubs, with exchanges in both cities recently proposing changes to their rules to lure more fast-growing technology companies. Hong Kong has dominated its rival when it comes to initial public offerings over the past few years, though Singapore remains competitive in other areas.Read the full report here.",0.0654541626572609,0.3418160378932953,0.5927297472953796

"SGX proposes adjustments to the equities market Changes include increasing minimum bid size for stocks and changing trading hours.Singapore Exchange (SGX) is planning to consult the public on its proposed adjustments to the equities market, which seek to address market conditions and balance the diverse objectives across varying segments of market participants.SGX is proposing to increase the minimum bid size for stocks and relevant securities trading to the $1.00 – $1.99 price range from the current 0.005 to $0.01, based on the decline in traded value in the $1.00 – $1.99 price range in recent years and lower retail participation in that price range compared to other price ranges.SGX also wants to widen the forced order range for stocks and relevant securities from the current +/-20 bids to +/-30 bids in response to market feedback to improve order entry efficiency.Responding to feedback that market participants prefer shorter trading hours, SGX is also proposing a one-hour mid-day break from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm, re-timed from the earlier mid-day break from 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm that was in place before continuous all-day trading (CAT) was implemented in 2011.The mid-day break allows SGX to retain significant overlap in trading hours with key markets in Asia, and coincides with lower trading activity of the day. During the break, market participants can enter and manage their orders and SGX will publish an indicative equilibrium price (IEP) based on orders received to facilitate price discovery and enable investors to better manage risks.“We recognise that the three proposed changes will affect segments of the market differently, and we will continue to calibrate and implement initiatives we believe are for the long-term interests of a vibrant and resilient market,” said Loh Boon Chye, chief executive officer of SGX.Those wishing to give feedback may send correspondence to Rules@sgx.com until 29 March 2017.",0.6156104207038879,0.02158532850444317,0.3628042936325073

"Why did it take long for Singapore to roll out video banking? Here are the challenges banks have to face.Video banking is no longer news in other developed countries, but in Singapore, the interest in merging video and banking is just starting to pick up as Standard Chartered Bank introduced the service last July 26. While in some countries, customers can now simply connect to the bank through an App on Android and Apple device, the service rolled out in Singapore only allows clients to speak with agents over a secure video connection from a location of their choice via their laptop. Singapore may seem slower in adopting this latest banking technology, but analysts say it is definitely the way to go in the coming years, but with obstacles.“This is undoubtedly the digital age and we are now even seeing banks venture into “hip new spaces” like Instagram so I think video banking service is long overdue,” said June Ho, director of law firm Wikborg Rein.According to Ho, consumer preferences have now certainly evolved with majority now very familiar and comfortable with online banking, as well as communicating via accessible and affordable video chat providers such as Skype and Facetime. Marrying the two, she said, is a natural progression and one now wonders why it took so long to implement in Singapore.Ho explained that customer preparedness and acceptance of this new service will be initial challenges but she believes that these are easy to overcome given that most Singaporeans are digitally-savvy and well-connected.Dominic Gamble, CEO and founder of wealth management firm, WEALTH, also believes that while there may be a perception problem with consumers in Singapore still not used to conducting their banking affairs online via video, this will not be a significant challenge.“Our experience with WEALTH shows that even those in the more traditional wealth management sector have enthusiastically embraced online and mobile as a means of managing their finances, but as a first mover, Standard Chartered will have to persuade consumers that this is an easier, safer and more efficient means of banking,” he said.According to Ho, the initial investment required to secure high quality connectivity from any location and on any device will also be a challenge but this should not be a big hindrance. She added that there will also be the usual threats and challenges about cyber security/privacy facing online banking as a whole and banks still need to ensure it has robust and secure cyber security measures in place.Will other banks follow suit?There might be hesitations among Singapore banks in recent years to adopt the latest technology, but with Standard Chartered Bank already taking the initial step, it’s probably only a matter of time before we see other banks following suit, said experts.“Banking is a highly competitive space. Banks need to follow closely what their competitors are offering the customers and stay relevant, or get left behind,” said Ho.According to Ho, video banking in particular is likely to benefit the international banks more as these banks tend to have a thinner distribution/outreach network than the local banks. This will be a very attractive platform for them to be more accessible to their existing customers as well as provide greater leverage to draw in new customers.Meanwhile, WEALTH’s Gamble noted that while mobile and online banking resulted in speedier banking services, it has also come at the cost of personalised service. Video banking, he said, is a way of offering more choice and more convenience to customers. He added that banks are starting to question the need and costs for so many brick-and-mortar branches.“Video banking is a way of bridging this, by providing a personalised, face-to-face service at the convenience of the consumer and hopefully at a lower cost,” he explained.Citing a recent report from banking association Efma and video collaboration technology maker Vidyo, Ho noted that 10% of banks will use video for banking services in 2016, 50% will use it by the end of 2017 and 80% by the end of 2018.According to Ho, Singapore is definitely a hotbed for this service as most Singaporeans are already mobile-connected and digitally savvy. Singapore, she added, is also one of the few countries which is densely wired up with high speed internet and so is definitely compatible with this new banking platform.Ho added that as technology is not constrained by space and time, it’s not unthinkable that in the near future, personal banking such as private banking, wealth management, mortgage/loan services can be done 24-7 from anywhere in the world without the need to even step outside your home/office.Gamble meanwhile sees opportunities in more specialised banking services, such as wealth management.“Widely perceived as ‘traditional’ and averse to technology, we are already seeing more investors go online to source their wealth management experts and services, rather than rely on word-of-mouth and referrals, which is proven to be an imperfect method of matching a wealth manager with their client,” he said.Gamble believes that Singapore’s wealth management industry will see a natural progression onto video, whereby wealth managers will be able to provide updates on their clients’ investments, advice and analysis in real time and face-to-face – through video. This means more convenience for investors – many of whom travel heavily and would appreciate the flexibility – and the ability to provide a high level of personalised service for the wealth manager.",0.25315120816230774,0.01615842431783676,0.7306903600692749

"Will Circles.Life be able to disrupt the status quo in the mobile sector? Here are the challenges it has to face.Liberty Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator (MNVO), has recently launched its mobile services under the Circles.Life The local start-up aims to offer the most innovative mobile service plans and unparalleled customer experience. Unlike other MVNOs, Circles.Life focuses on post-paid mobile customers.Its entry as an MVNO emphasises the trend of increasing competition for incumbent mobile operators. Will it be successful?Here's what analysts had to say:Jonathan Koh, analyst, UOBKayHianLiberty Wireless/Circles.Life faces challenges from incumbent mobile operators.First, there is limited publicity for the launch of Liberty Wireless/Circles.Life. There was no advertising campaign through TV or newspapers. Consumers could only obtain information mainly through its website and Facebook page. Liberty Wireless was scheduled to commence commercial operations by end-15 but the much-awaited launch only took place in May 16.Second, Circles.Life’s pricing is not necessarily cheaper compared with similar SIM-only plans from incumbent mobile operators. Both Singtel and Circles.Life allow customers to custom-build their SIM-only plans. For a basic SIM-only plan with 200min of voicecalls and 3GB of data, Singtel charges S$25.35 compared with S$32 by Circles.Life.Circles.Life is more expensive when topping up for additional voice minutes, SMSes and data. However, it is provides more flexibility as the size of top-ups is more granular.Third, incumbent mobile operators offer affordable pre-paid service plans with attractive rates for iDD calls. For example, Singtel charges S$0.22/min for calls to Indonesia (Telkomsel number). For Philippines, Singtel charges S$0.34 for the first minute and S$0.16/min thereafter (Globe number). Comparatively, Circles.Life charges S$0.62/min for Indonesia and S$0.17/min for Philippines.BMIThe possible entrance of a fourth operator has gained much attention due to the prospect of cheaper mobile data bundles and advanced mobile network quality, which will be difficult for MVNOs to achieve without network ownership and pricing control. Pricing-wise, Circles.Life's offering is comparable to the SIM-only plans the three existing mobile networks operators launched in 2015 to provide a cheaper alternative to the market norm of handset-bundled postpaid plans. Further, M1's mobile network speed does not stand out as a selling point for MVNOs. According to Opensignal's State of the LTE report for Q415, M1's LTE network's speeds trail its rivals at 29Mbps, compared to StarHub's 39Mbps and SingTel's 40Mbps.That said, Circles.Life's value proposition is in providing subscribers the flexibility to customise their plans to their changing mobile data needs at just SGD6 for each gigabyte of mobile data above the 3GB base. Being able to anticipate their data usage and alter their data allowance each month to cater to that could entice postpaid subscribers who wish to avoid the penalty fee incurred for exceeding their monthly mobile data caps. StarHub reports that 22% of postpaid subscribers exceeded their data caps in Q116 and this 'penalty fee' has been a steady revenue stream for operators in Singapore's postpaid-led mobile market.However, subscribers that desire flexibility usually opt for prepaid pay-as-you use plans and Circles.Life will need to offer postpaid bundles that can rival network operators' fixed broadband and pay-TV services in order to impact the competitive landscape. This will require licensing and regulatory approval, but is not a daunting task considering Singapore has a Next Gen NBN national fibre broadband network and an abundance of OTT video streaming services that Circles.Life can partner with.This will enable the MVNO to tap consumption trends even without network ownership. StarHub's quarterly report, which shows that 31.5% of its 771,000 households subscribed to triple-play services in Q116, is a suitable illustration of Singapore's appetite for fixed-mobile converged services. However, with international OTT video streaming services like Viu and Netflix gaining traction, a partnership with such as service could enable Liberty Wireless to put forth a more attractive offer.Carey Wong, OCBC Investment ResearchNew MVNO Circles.Life has announced its pricing plan for its post-paid mobile services; basic plan starts from S$28 for 3GB of data, 100 minutes of talk time and no contract. Usage of OTT serviceslike Whatsapp (for voice and messaging) also does not consume data. Although the plan does not come with any free SMS, users can pay an extra S$4/month for 100 SMS. But as the plansdo not offer any phone subsidies, consumers can buy phones on interest-free installments. Still, compared to current plans from the incumbent telcos, Circles.Life plans are not very much cheaper; nor do they offer “unlimited” data as what MyRepublic intends to offer if it wins the 4th telco license. As such, we do not expect to see the incumbents making any drastic changes to their price",0.23460239171981812,0.019189471378922462,0.7462081909179688

"14 listed firms most likely to be privatized or taken over Tech firms are higly targeted.A flurry of offers for listed companies has gripped the Singapore market lately. OCBC Investment Research said that given how much share prices have declined and how attractive valuations are for certain companies out there, it is not surprising that bargain hunters are once again on the prowl for good deals.At the same time, OCBC added that world flush with liquidity has meant that capital costs have remained low, especially for stronger corporates and individuals.To obtain a list of potential candidates for privatisation, OCBC screen for stocks that are unloved and trading with low Price/NTA ratios. From this list, it searched for companies that are net cash, have large shareholders that are able (and perhaps willing) to control the entire entity, for reasons such as greater operational flexibility and the opportunity to relist in the future (either in Singapore or overseas) at better valuations. Also, considering the huge ownership, moves to trigger a privatisation should not be too difficult, if a decision to do so is made.OCBC also looks out for companies whose insiders have been scooping up shares recently.

CNMC Goldmine (+10%; BUY TP $0.48) continued to outperform the market, reaching its highest levels in more than 3 years.Given the cautious outlook, REITs and the Telecom sector gained between 1-2% as investors shifted to a more defensive strategy. The chances of a US rate hike by December 2016 has decreased to 15%, from 50% before the Brexit vote, according to Fed fund futures. This could lend further support to gold prices and gold companies like CNMC Goldmine, one of our current top picks.",0.05192016810178757,0.9198722243309021,0.02820763550698757

Our preference is for S-REITs with outsized yields and opportunities to surprise on the upside through acquisitions or with portfolios that continue to withstand operational uncertainties,” said DBS.DBS also said that S-REITs should consider paying a higher proportion of management fees in cash to maintain sustainability.“A regular feature amongst S-REITs, the payment of management fees in the form of units has the benefit of aligning managers’ interests with unitholders. However, we do see potential issues going forward if S-REIT managers continue to maintain its current structure of paying a substantial portion of its fees in units,” DBS said. DBS noted that as most REITs are trading below their respective NAVs and have a modest DPU growth profile.“The continued issuance of new units will have the unintended consequence of eroding NAV per unit and diluting future DPU,” said DBS.",0.5012508034706116,0.3820165991783142,0.11673253774642944

"Beaten down property developer stocks poised to outperform this year: report Look beyond the pessimism, investors urged.It’s time to stop punishing Singapore’s property developers, according to a report by CIMB.Although the property market will remain mired in problems this year—particularly weak demand and a significant supply glut—CIMB noted that unjustifiably cheap property stocks might be worth a shot now, after they have declined by 14% since the beginning of the year.“While we agree that 2016 will be another challenging year for the physical property market, on the back of weak demand and significant supply overhanging the sector, we believe that investors should look beyond this pessimistic scenario. Our base case assumption would be for Singapore to be stable, even though experiencing low growth,” CIMB said.CIMB added that though there is a significant disconnect between equity and underlying asset values, there is still good interest in buying opportunities in the physical market.

We see a relatively favorable investment outlook for Singapore, based on its attractive valuations combined with trough cyclical profitability, potentially reduced economic and currency volatility,” said Morgan Stanley in a recent report.Others, however, fear that local equities may have greater room to fall.“The four big sectors – offshore & marine, property, REITs and banks – are all under pressure and our test results suggest that their biggest challenges could still lie ahead as rising interest rates, falling oil prices and depreciating currencies collide with declining pricing power and sluggish demand,” said a report from Maybank Kim Eng.",0.00854670163244009,0.9746232628822327,0.016829928383231163

"Singapore stock market is one of Asia’s worst performers in 2015: report The oil downturn is a key culprit.Singapore’s Straits Times Index (STI) is one of the worst-performing stock indices in Asia, according to a report by OCBC.In the Asia-Pacific region, the year-to-date performance ranged from -13% for the Jakarta Composite Index to +60% for the Shenzhen Composite Index.The STI, with a year-to-date performance of -15%, is one of the key underperformers in this region this year, OCBC said. “This was led by share price declines of key stocks in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, REIT and Banking sectors. Not surprisingly, Oil & Gas and Commodity stocks listed on the local exchange were dragged lower by the sharp decline in global oil and other commodity prices,” OCBC said. “In addition, the austerity drive in China was also acutely felt in Singapore’s retail and consumer sector, while companies with China exposure had a complete change of fortunes from the Chinese stock markets rally in Apr to being causalities, falling in line with the slower outlook for the Chinese economy,” OCBC added.",0.009882780723273754,0.9729150533676147,0.01720205694437027
"More pain ahead for Singapore stocks after dreary Q3 earnings season Fundamaentals are weak, analysts warn.Downside risks are piling up for locally-listed stocks, after most companies reported disappointing numbers in the third quarter.A report by Maybank Kim Eng highlighted that there are now more reasons to be bearish on local companies, as Q3 earnings mostly disappointed while free cash flow and balance sheets also deteriorated.Maybank Kim Eng is particularly disappointed with the offshore and marine sector, which had been hit by more delivery deferrals and debt provisioning.""Many companies are treading on thin margins. Earnings quality in 3Q was poor, with results propped up by forex or one-off disposal gains. Credit problems have started to surface,"" said Maybank Kim Eng.Meanwhile, although healthcare stocks looked fairly resilient, Maybank Kim Eng warned that investors should stay cautious as these stocks have relatively rich valuations.""While investors looked past 3Q15 earnings misses, caution is justified as poor project execution or delays in M&A, which are largely concentrated in China and Malaysia, could lead to a valuation de-rating,"" said Maybank Kim Eng.Overall, Maybank Kim Eng believes that Singapore stocks are headed for greater disappointment as fundamentals remain weak and risks are not yet fully priced in.“We cut EPS for nearly all sectors, except Consumer, Telcos, Banks, and Property.

"More pain ahead for the Straits Times Index after painful August sell-down Gains will be limited as uncertainties mount.After local stocks tumbled in an extremely dreary August, DBS analysts warned that the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) is unlikely to recover back to July’s level of 3300 points.This is because the culprits behind last month’s steep decline—namely, the impending start of the US rate hike cycle, weak regional currencies, Asian growth slowdown and falling oil prices—continue to overshadow the market’s recovery prospects.“The current technical rebound is brought about by oversold technicals and valuations falling to a relatively attractive level as a result of the recent sell-down. However, we do not see a V-shape recovery back to July’s level of 3300 anytime soon,” DBS said in a report.Apart from these external headwinds, Singapore equities are also at risk from the rising spectre of technical recession, which has become more likely after poor July manufacturing figures.DBS expects the STI to be traded within the 2750 to 3050 range. Any gains could be capped at the 3050 level, below DBS’ revised bottom-up 12 month STI target of 3200 points.“The market remains fragile and susceptible to macro events unfolding over the next two months.

It can be recalled that Chinese names in the north caught fire, with the Hang Seng gaining almost 10% just last week alone.Here’s more from CMC Markets:While last week’s funds flows have mainly been the result of Chinese money let loose to buy into HK, another factor is the fund flows coming into Asia from other continents. Often, this has been in the form of new funds raised for Asian-committed ETFs.If that is the case, Singapore shares may also benefit - perhaps even out of default - from any spill-over and perhaps even attempt to narrow the disparity in performance with their North-Asian counterparts.Several triggers may drive action here this week. For one, the government is scheduled to release preliminary GDP numbers on Tuesday, before the market opens.This week we will also see the beginning of the first-quarter reporting season, with announcements from several blues like SPH and the Keppel stable of companies.While earnings for Singapore-listed companies are not expected to be very flattering, a lot of this may already be reflected in the prices of their shares here.

However, the local bourse’s new cash cow may be under threat from the domination of FTSE China A50 Index Futures.According to Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets, it’s no surprise that the derivatives business drove the strong numbers, with the lion’s share coming from the explosive 165% y-o-y increase in trading volume on the FTSE China A50 Index futures.He noted that quarterly trading volumes on the FTSE China A50 contract are now more than 40% of total derivatives volumes for SGX.Operating profit margins were a bit of a letdown, as expenses grew faster than the top line, with an increase in salaries and investment in technology.“A key worry for the SGX and their derivative business may be the ‘concentration’ on the China A50 future contract.

"Chart of the Day: DBS better positioned for interest rate hike Owing to its superior funding structure.Bank margins in Singapore are at their lowest level in five years, and higher interest rates will widen margins and improve pre-provision profitability, with DBS set to benefit the most.According to a report by Moody’s Investor Service, higher interest rates in the US and Singapore will have a greater positive effect on DBS's earnings, owing to its superior funding structure.Moody’s says that DBS has a lower cost of funding owing to a higher share of low-yielding customer deposits. This will lead to reduced upward pressure on its funding costs in a rising interest rate environment. Among the peer group, DBS has the highest share of current accounts and saving accounts in total deposits, owing to its superior market share in consumer deposits and larger branch network in Singapore. This competitive advantage traces back in part to 1998, when DBS acquired Post Office Saving Bank (unrated) in Singapore.Here’s more from Moody’s:DBS's higher-quality funding base is beneficial for its liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs). DBS reported a very high SGD LCR of 424% as of 31 March 2015, higher than 273% at OCBC. DBS's all-currency LCR was also stronger at 131%, compared to 117% at OCBC. UOB has not reported its LCRs, however these ratios are above 100% according to the bank. The Monetary Authority of Singapore requires large banks to comply with a 100% SGD LCR and 60% all-currency LCR from 1 January 2015; the latter increases by 10% every year until it reaches 100% on 1 January 2019.",0.8715160489082336,0.03201064467430115,0.0964733138680458

MAS will extend its regulatory regime to OTC derivatives trading platforms and intermediaries, and introduce simplified, principles-based definitions of securities and derivatives.While MAS has assessed that it is not necessary to mandate a trading regime for OTC derivatives for now, it will assume powers to implement a trading regime if such a regime was deemed necessary in the future.MAS will continue to monitor developments, consult the industry closely, and conduct detailed analysis to determine the conditions that might make a trading mandate necessary.MAS is also proposing to transfer regulatory oversight of commodity derivatives from the Commodity Trading Act (CTA), currently administered by International Enterprise (IE) Singapore, to the SFA.The proposed legislative amendments to the SFA will allow MAS to strengthen Singapore’s securities market in two key areas: The proposal to require reporting of short selling of securities trading and publication of aggregate short positions will improve transparency in the short selling of securities.

"Daily Market Briefing: STI closes flat But it could be heading higher.According to OCBC, the STI, which ended flat on Friday, could still be heading higher despite the muted Wall Street showing. This is because daily technical indicators are starting to look a tad more positive.Here’s more from OCBC:We note that the daily MACD looks close to cutting up, while the daily stochastic indicator has already cut up inside the oversold region recently. The price action also suggests that the downside looks pretty well protected, with a firm base around 3319 (middle of Bollinger Band), which is also the 30-DMA. We see the next support at 3276 (lower Bollinger Band, also 100-DMA); although there is a parabolic sell trigger at 3281.

During October, the short term 30 day volatility gauge of the STI was below the annualised five year volatility level of 13.0% and below the annualised three year volatility level of 10.8%.

"SGX struggles to attract investors as trading values plunge A turnaround is unlikely in upcoming quarters.Singapore Exchange posted uninspiring results for 1QFY15. Its net earnings declined 16% year-on-year to $77.6m, while revenue slipped 8% year-on-year to $168.9m.According to OCBC, the low figures were unsurprising given the ongoing plunge in the SGX’s securities daily average traded value (SDAV). SDAV has been on a downtrend since the first quarter of 2013, moving down from S$1.7b to S$1.0b by the latest quarter.“The drag came from the Securities market, which continued to experience low trading activities. Securities daily average traded value (SDAV) fell 27% YoY to S$1.0b. For stocks priced below 20 cents, this plunged 66% to S$0.1b. This lacklustre trend is unlikely to get any reprieve in 4QCY2014 based on early Oct numbers,” noted OCBC.In an attempt to boost its sub-par performance and lure more investors, the SGX has been intensifying its efforts to bring more activities to the local bourse.“SGX has also introduced market makers and liquidity providers in Jun 2014 in an effort to increase liquidity and depth to the market. Next year, the standard board-lot size will be reduced from 1000 shares to 100 shares. On the operating side, management is expecting tech-related capital expenditure of between S$50-55m and guiding for operating expenses of S$330-340m for FY15,” stated the report.Here’s more from OCBC:SGX’s overall performance was fortunately mitigated by other businesses and Derivatives revenue now accounted for about 32% of total revenue.Total volumes of derivatives contracts rose 9% to 28.8m in 1Q. The China index futures, the FTSE A50, accounted for 10.8m contracts during the same period.Based on current market conditions and the lack of key Singapore market specific news, it was not surprising that the SDAV on the local bourse has been falling in the last four quarters. Recent efforts by the SGX to increase the profile of listed companies, attract more institutional interest and to explore more collaboration could over time bring in more activities onto the local bourse.",0.015790317207574844,0.9657639265060425,0.0184458140283823
"Singapore overtakes Mumbai as biggest market for Indian futures We climbed 55% as they declined 60%.Singapore is overtaking Mumbai as the biggest market for Indian stock-index futures, a sign of foreign investors’ growing influence over equities in the world’s second-most populous nation.Bloomberg’s Chart of the Day shows open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts, for CNX Nifty Index futures on the Singapore Exchange Ltd. climbed 55 percent during the past four years to about 345,000. That compares with a 60 percent decline for similar contracts traded on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Singapore is luring foreign investors with longer hours and lower trading costs, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report this month.Bloomberg adds that international money managers have bought more than $14 billion of Indian shares this year, helping fuel a 29 percent rally in the Nifty index. Much of the gains have come since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s landslide election victory in May, with investors betting the new premier will boost growth in Asia’s third-largest economy.“New offshore investors have started nibbling at India,” said A.S. Thiyaga Rajan, a senior managing director at Aquarius Investment Advisors Pte in Singapore, which has $450 million in Indian stocks. “Already-invested guys are also increasing exposure on optimism the new administration will boost growth.”“NSE and SGX have been in long-term partnership to develop the global Nifty franchise,” the Singapore Exchange wrote by e-mail. “SGX provides a convenient access point for offshore investors seeking exposure to Indian equity and complements the already deep liquid equity and derivatives markets in India.”",0.9432427883148193,0.02095996029675007,0.03579718992114067

"3 methods Singaporeans must know in managing finances As a financial speaker and author, I often heard my Singaporean friends tell me that ""budgeting doesn't work! “The truth is that I am not much of a 'budgeter' myself?Once upon a time, I remember being charged up after reading personal finance books that showed mathematically why saving a dollar a day could help me become a millionaire. The lesson then point to the need for budgeting and saving up every single cent.This totally makes “cents” to me and I would carry a black note book with me and record every single financial decision I make throughout the day which ranges for buying a “kopi” for $0.90 to pumping petrol for $98.70. I am happy to announce that this practice lasted for… 3 days at most?Slowly, I realized that personal financial management is similar to personal fitness in the sense that we need to build up our muscles and habits. Trying to have a quick financial make over and changing finance habits is like trying to go on a crash diet and/or become fit by suddenly running a marathon one time without any foundations.To do it properly with long term effects, I highly recommend making small changes and systemizing it into our lives. Here some methods to do that1. Budget One Day Each Time.Instead of doing up your 5-years or even 1-year plan, start a simple budget just for tomorrow. This is akin to start by doing 10 push ups and getting your body conditioned. Even as you are reading right now, take out your smartphone or your black notebook and try forecasting what you will be spending tomorrow.Write the items down and review it at the end of tomorrow. Start by practicing this once a week and you will begin to see some trends and gain some financial muscles. Once you are comfortable, go on to forecast a 1-week, 1-month, then 1-year budget. And remember, allow yourself to miss, this game is about consistent action, not perfection.2. Use Fun Events to Strengthen Your Financial Muscles.While fun sports and outdoor activity has been one of the best ways to get us started and continuing in our physical build up, budgeting for fun events can be a great way to entice us to start learning how to manage our finances.Since year-end is here, you can plan for a holiday or Christmas party. Each of these ventures requires certain amount of financial resources doesn’t it? Sit down and do a fun plan for an event that you know you will enjoy. How much will the transportation, accommodations, food, shopping and insurance costs?Use a spreadsheet to help you and you may be pleasantly surprise how the categories of our monthly living budget is similar to a holiday’s expenses. Perhaps as you budget for a fun event, you may actually start to associate budgeting to having fun (like exercising being fun in sports), and continue this habit.3. Use A “Passport” System.This is one of my favorite methods, as I love to simplify and systemize my finances. The whole idea is to select one bank account and make sure ALL your income goes into that account.Once this account captures all the inflow of your income, it will also be able to capture any outflow like your paying for house mortgage, insurance premium, and transportation expenses. I call this the passport system because all your monies will need to pass this bank account’s checkpoint and will be recorded.I use this method and just to share that up till today, I still cannot reconcile all my expenses. There will be a couple of transactions which I cannot remember but overall I have a broad picture and it helps me in knowing how much I have to save and invest monthly.Our Singapore banks are making it even easier now as banks like OCBC even have an inbuilt system to help you track and customize your spending. We can also open different bank accounts for different purposes but we need to of course consider the minimum deposit and balance.But even if you choose to do that, I will still suggest that you choose your central account where all inflow and outflow is captured!Here are 3 tips to help you get started and I look forward to exploring any other methods you may have. To conclude, keep it simple, make it a system and get started!",0.04597868025302887,0.03450512886047363,0.9195161461830139

"5 things you need to know before trading stocks in Singapore As a trading representative in Singapore, I work closely with corporations, AI(Accredited Investors) and retailers to fulfil their investment needs. As with all endeavours in life, I believe the key to success is knowledge and action.We have to understand the inner workings of the markets, before we can expand our knowledge efficiently with it. With SGX plan to transition into high frequency trading and with the recent implementation of GTM(Good Till Maximum)/GTD(Good Till Date) orders, local traders will have more arsenal to deploy from their repertoire.With the infrastructure coming into place, it should make it easier for new traders to join the trading bandwagon. So here are the five things that we should know before trading stocks in Singapore.1) Stock trading is risky business. The trading limits you use have to be acceptable to you; do not risk what you aren’t willing to lose.2) Focus on managing probabilities and emotions. I have come to terms with the fact that human choices are mostly emotionally driven; hence they are difficult to be precisely determined and can only be plausibly predicted with a standard deviation.Mentally, we should not strive to think of rigid solutions when making trading decisions as the market will not give consistent answers.3) It is crucial to have our own personal coherent concept of the markets, how they work and the types of mistakes that we believe consistently underlie local investors’ behaviour. Knowing these concepts will enable us to have a more systematic approach.4) Learn technical analysis. Technical analysis should be regarded as the art of assessing the technical position of a particular security with the aid of several scientifically researched indicators.A good working knowledge of the principles underlying major price movements in financial markets and a balanced view of the overall technical position offer a superior framework within which to operate.5) Pick the stock to trade not solely on their beta value, but on their financials and business models. This is to prevent you from trading a dud. With numerous suspensions from small caps recently due to accounting problems, it is better to stay prudent.",0.08356980979442596,0.017771238461136818,0.8986589312553406

"Singapore startup launches stock market simulation app It draws real-time data from 14 stock exchanges.Participating in stock trading may be intimidating for most casual investors and deciding on the right trades to make can be an impossible task. Experienced traders have the knowledge and expertise, but without any incentive there is no reason to share information with other investors.TradeHero aims to bridge the gap by providing a platform where anyone can make money from the financial markets, by subscribing to the expert trade feeds of top traders as guidelines for your real-life trades, or becoming a top trader and earning monthly subscription fees from other users who follow your trade feeds.TradeHero is a stock market simulation mobile app that draws real-time data from 14 stock exchanges, 45,000 global securities and 1,300 currency pairs. Users are credited with a $100,000 starting portfolio and can make trades to create their own virtual portfolio.The app’s Leaderboards identify the most successful traders (known as ‘Heroes’) by their returns, and they are ranked by Exchange, Sector, Monthly or Quarterly returns, as well as overall returns.Followers can subscribe, for a small monthly fee, to follow and receive trade feeds from their chosen Heroes via push notifications on their mobile device. These push notifications detail each Buy and Sell action of the Hero, allowing followers to receive expert trading tips and personal insight into successful investment strategies. TradeHero will share subscription revenue from followers equally with Heroes, thus allowing Heroes to monetize their trading expertise.""TradeHero makes learning about the stock market much less intimidating for novice investors, by making the whole process of buying and selling stocks fun and intuitive. The app has won many positive user reviews, with users praising the user interface and how much they enjoy learning about stocks by playing TradeHero,"" said TradeHero CEO Dinesh Bhatia.TradeHero is also billed as the first social investment network, where users can make market comments and give advice on stock selection.How TradeHero startedAccording to Bhatia, the idea of TradeHero came about after he suffered a significant loss on the stock market while working on a startup in the US in 2010. ""I thought to myself, why is it that we (the man on the street) is always the greater fool and started researching more into the subject and realised that the odds were very much stacked against the retail investor in equities markets or anywhere institutions partook as well. I decided that the only way things would and could change is to harness a crowd-sourced effect in terms of tipping the scale and helping retail investors make much more informed decisions.""TradeHero plans to push out an Android version of the app, as well as expand to other markets such as Hong Kong and China. According to Bhatia, partnerships with large financial institutions and brokerages are being discussed as well. He added that multiple pivot points based on the basic premise of information brokerage will be developed, utilizing much of the current platform to accelerate development efforts.""We are very optimistic about the future of TradeHero. Revenue and user growth is currently exceeding our initial targets and estimates and we hit our 12 month user target in just 2 months.

"S-REITs under pressure from bond yield hikes Bond yields spiked over 100 bps.Despite reporting a firm set of financial performance in 2Q13 (growing top line and stable interest costs), S-REITs share prices continue to remain under pressure. According to DBS Vickers Securiies, the weakness in share prices appears to derive from fund outflows and heightened required returns rather than weakening fundamentals.Here's more from DBS:S-REITs stock prices remain under pressure from further hikes in government bonds. Our Jun’13 report (As the dustsettles, value emerges) that called for value hunting within the S-REITs has met with little success. While we were right in our observation that S-REITs earnings will continue to show resilience and exhibit further growth ability, we have, however, over the past 2 months seen further pressure on S-REIT’s stock prices, with the FSTREI falling by a further 4%.One of the main reasons for the weakness in share price can be attributable to outflows from the S-REITs, due to expectations of further increases in government long bond yields, which had spiked >100 bps of a possible tapering down of QE3, impacting required returns for the S-REITs.We believe that if the yield curve were to hold/rise from current levels, this could potentially affect opportunity cost for holding on to yield stocks like the S-REITs and result in higher borrowing costs when SREITs refinance their debt.Further long bond yield hike, forecasts by DBS Group interest rate strategist. DBS Group’s interest rate strategist has, over the course of the past 2 months, further hiked his expectation for the 10-year US treasury yields to increase by another 115 bps over the next 4 quarters to 4.0% by middle of 2014.

Much of this is due to a fall in pharmaceutical and electronic exports. Both are traditionally volatile sectors.Although this non-oil export data is worse than feared, many attribute this to the Lunar New Year.

On the downside, 3140 is still the immediate support, with the subsequent base pegged at the 3110 key resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:After yesterday’s BoJ additional stimulus announcement we saw the yen initially gain back some of the lost ground, as much was already seemingly priced in to the currency. In addition the Nikkei was the rank underperformer in Asia. However, the buy USDJPY on dips strategy still seems to be paying dividends as we’ve seen the pair trade move from below 84 back towards 84.50 overnight.Unsurprisingly in response the Nikkei has opened as one of the stronger markets this morning, gaining back a large piece of yesterday’s fall as we stand around 1% higher, with equities continuing to prosper as the currency weakens.Gold continues its year end spin, falling as low $1635 in overnight trade, before recover to currently stand closer to the $1650 level.QE expectations falling on the back of the rosier US numbers have dented the precious metal’s outlook. With technical analysts spotting bearish signals on the charts and less funds now expected in the system from QE we could see further pressure as we enter the New Year.Oil responded positively to the US numbers as front month WTI pushed up above $90.As we look ahead to the last day of trading before we enter Christmas week, we are once again knocking on the door of fresh 2012 highs for our benchmark, as we call the STI to open 0.5% firmer.",0.7991586923599243,0.17497536540031433,0.025865936651825905
"STI up 0.4% Gains could be limited though because of Apple results.OCBC Investment Research said:Continued strength on Wall Street overnight should see the local bourse get off to a positive start this morning.However, the weaker-than-expected earnings from Apple could limit gains, especially since US index futures are already lower in early trade (Nasdaq down 1.7%).The STI has cracked the 3230 resistance yesterday, but just barely, suggesting that the market remains somewhat cautious.Furthermore, we note that penny stocks and situational plays continue to remain in focus, which may also be another signal that there is some “froth” in the market. As such, failure of the index to sustain above 3230 could spark profit-taking back to 3200 or even 3150. On the upside, 3250 is the next hurdle, ahead of 3280.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Much of today’s play in Asian markets will centre on China’s flash PMI data and Japan’s trade deficit numbers.Yesterday the local blue chip index continued its slow and steady rise as it gained 0.4% to leave it at 3231 last night.This morning, the futures markets now points to a lower open for the STI, as the effect of the disappointing Apple earnings is to have reversed the earlier positive leads.",0.034360308200120926,0.940125048160553,0.025514651089906693

The daily MACD has also fallen below the centre-line and is currently still looking quite negative.As such, the index’s failure to clear the key 3000 hurdle could see it easing back towards the next key support around 2904.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In Singapore, the Fraser & Neave drama will enjoy another twist this week when a largely defunct 22 November deadline kicks in for the conglomerate to consider the $8.88 a share offer from the Thais.After OUE’s $9.08 a share offer was launched last week it threw the ball back in Thai tycoon Charoen’s court to come up with an improved offer. The clock is now ticking as shareholders wait to see what he’ll come up as he looks reluctant to give up the fight for F&N.But shareholders will definitely have to wait for any bumper payday. F&N has said it won’t distribute the $54 billion proceeds from its sale of Asia Pacific Breweries back to shareholders until the takeover tussle is over.If Charoen has his way, there will be no such capital reduction.The futures market is pointing to a firmer open for the STI this morning as it looks to start it push back to the promised land of 3000, after slipping back to 2945 last week.Returns for the STI this year have dropped to 11% and are less than spectacular as the second half of the year fails to live up to a strong first six months.",0.018727567046880722,0.9609302878379822,0.020342135801911354
"Indian healthcare provider plans Singapore IPO Expert says around S$510.8mn will be raised from the IPO, even higher than the firm expects.Religare Health Trust, on Monday (October 15) announced that it is looking to raise a total of $417.9 million from Singapore IPO. RHT is scheduled to list on the third week of Oct-12. 95% of the proceeds will be uitilised to partially fund the initial portfolio. Its initial portfolio consists of 11 clinical establishments (S$714mn), four greenfield clinical establishments (S$29mn) and two hospitals managed and operated by RHT (S$5mn), which are all geographically diversified across India.But according to PhillipCapital, approximately S$510.8mn will be raised from the public offering. ""At the IPO price of S$0.90, RHT is trading at one time to its book value and appears inexpensive,"" it said.Here's from Travis Seah, anlyst at PhillipCapital:RHT provides unique value proposition for investors to have exposure to the growing demand of quality healthcareservices in India and Asia Pacific. We like RHT’s service fee revenues term structure that offers both downside protection (15 years term with annual escalation of 3%) and upside potential (7.5% of Fortis companies’ operating revenue). In addition, rising affluence in upper middle class segment and underserved Indian healthcare market would benefit RHT. Foreign exchange risk is the main concern for RHT but forward contracts are put in place to hedge the currency translation up to FY2014.On the valuation, RHT is priced at one time to book. The price of RHT appears inexpensive on the P/B basis relativeto the rich P/B valuation of Ascendas India Trust (a-iTrust) at 1.27 times which is way above its historical P/B mean of 0.83. Annualised FY13 dividend yield of 9.0% including the distribution wavier (up to FY2014), looks appealing given the current slow growth and yield-starved period. By stripping out the distribution wavier, the yield is around 6.5% which is lower than a-iTrust yield of 7.1%.

The telco has been hit by the strengthening Singapore dollar as it repatriates earnings from some of its overseas subsidiaries and partnerships.But those foreign earnings are also under pressure themselves, namely India’s Bharti Airtel which saw profits plummet 30% along with weaknesses from its Australian unit Optus. With SingTel now active in 10 overseas markets across Asia and Africa, currency exposure could trip it up yet again as it looks to replace slowing domestic demand with international expansion.There was more bad news from Genting as the novelty factor of Singapore’s casinos looks to be running out. The casino giant saw a 20% fall in gaming revenues for Q3 while profits slid 47%.Investors hope this is a temporary blip and gamblers come back to tables when the economy picks up rather than the start of a more significant shift away from Singapore’s casinos.

According to JLL’s latest estimates, prime luxury home prices fell 0.8% q-q (5.6% y-y) in 4Q12 and are now 13.6% below the 4Q07 peak.In addition, there are still many unsold units in the prime residential areas (over 10,000 units in the CCR on our numbers). That being said, even units at Cliveden do not transact at 40% below their 2007 prices.Moreover, even though it is still nowhere near the levels seen in 2007 (or even 2010), transaction volume of prime luxury homes that cost over SGD5mn each appears to be slowly picking up from the trough that followed the introduction of the Additional Buyers’ Stamp Duty (ABSD) in December 2011.",0.021397843956947327,0.956059992313385,0.02254214696586132

The US awaited non-farm payrolls data with eager anticipation after last week’s shock contraction in its GDP. The 157,000 figure for January was slightly lower than the 160,000 consensus but showed job creation remained robust, without being spectacular.But what did excite US bulls was a upward revision in November and December figures. The highlight was November’s revised jobs data coming in at 247,000. The revision of previous months' data is often looked at by investors for the real guide to the health of the economy, with significant revisions upwards cheered, and concerns raised when numbers are lowered.This was enough to push Wall Street to fresh multi-year highs, a trend likely to continue as bulls lift equities higher and higher. The S&P 500 gained 1% to hit a new five-year high while the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.1% to break through the 14,000 barrier.",0.9232684969902039,0.053363025188446045,0.023368535563349724
"STI shows signs of 'breaking down' Analyst says chances of bouncing back could be challenged by the poor show from US equities.OCBC Investment Research said:The more than 1% plunge on Wall Street overnight is likely to spook the local bourse to a further retreat this morning although losses could be moderated by the positive Nikkei start (up 0.4% now).As a recap, the STI had already shown signs of breaking down yesterday after closing nearly 1% lower at its intraday low and below the 2980 key support.And with today’s tone likely to deteriorate further, we could see the index slipping further towards the 2930 key trough.Below that, the subsequent base lies at the 2900 psychological support. On the upside, 2980 is the immediate support-turned-resistance, with the next obstacle marked at the 3020 support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Yesterday the STI dropped 1% plunging it below the 3000 threshold. Any chances of bouncing back could be challenged today by last night’s poor show from US equities. The futures market points to a weak open for the local market this morning. We see a floor for the STI at around 2960.The positive news is that commodity player Olam posted a 26% rise in profits during Q3 bucking the recent trend of poor corporate earnings coming from Singapore blue chips.And today’s the day for OUE to launch its counter bid for Fraser & Neave after setting a 15 November deadline. The Thais are banking on OUE failing to launch a rival bid, as they themselves have not improved their $8.88 current offer.Should OUE fail to come up with a deal, through lack of funding or big-name partners, it will leave egg on their faces and some panic among F&N shareholders that the share price might slide back towards $8.88.",0.019110970199108124,0.9613534808158875,0.01953558810055256
"Daily Markets Briefing: STI to open 0.5% lower It ended the session flat.According to IG Markets Singapore:Asia suffered a volatile mixed bag yesterday as the Nikkei 225 rocketed 2.4% while the ASX 200 fell 1.5%. Sitting in the middle was the STI which ended the session flat.Traders were preoccupied with the budget statement which tackled some hot button issues like foreign workers, income gaps and productivity. With many Western companies threatening to leave Singapore over the tightening labour market, the government faces a tough challenge as it looks to keep voters happy with foreign talent curbs.The government will be tougher on companies hiring foreign managers and professionals while foreign worker levies were increased. This will make it even tougher for multinationals to operate on the island and could force many to relocate to cheaper bases. This morning we are pricing the STI to open 0.5% lower.",0.014306120574474335,0.9645053744316101,0.02118845097720623

On the downside, 3110 is still the immediate resistance-turned-support, with the subsequent base pegged at the 3080 minor resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In Singapore today, Singapore Airlines can look forward to banking $360 million from the sale of its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic after agreeing to offload it to Delta Airlines. Despite acquiring the stake back in 1999 for $965 million this will go down as a profit, as losses had already been accounted for in previous years.While major SIA shareholder Temasek will hardly be rubbing its hands with glee it may take the focus off some its other worrisome holdings, namely Olam, which has not rebounded the way its bosses had hoped.Unsurprisingly we look set to start the day on a positive note in Singapore, as we currently price in a 1% gain at the open for the STI. This means we could open at a fresh high for 2012 and potentially have the 3200 level within in our sights for the first time since August 2011.",0.9115940928459167,0.05177896469831467,0.036626994609832764

While Thai tycoon Charoen has said he has no plans to break up the conglomerate others are not so sure.Things also look cloudy for Japanese drinks manufacturer and rival Kirin which could still approach the Thais for the soft drinks business, but this seems unlikely to happen given that ThaiBev would equally benefit from the synergies with this part of the F&N portfolio.In addition they would need to significantly improve the low ball offer that they had made as part of rival OUE’s takeover offer.In fact things are so open one couldn’t rule out something strange playing out, such as OUE now approaching Charoen for another slug at some part of F&N’s property empire.The STI slipped a little yesterday but based on the futures market this morning it looks set to open in positive territory.",0.8504226207733154,0.08004004508256912,0.06953732669353485

As such, failure to clear 3259 (May 08 high) could precipitate some profit-taking. Nevertheless, we could still continue to see some switching into high-beta plays (cyclical commodities etc) and other situational small-cap plays, as risk appetite returns.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:On the local front the STI rocketed 1.1% as it finally broke through the 3200 threshold and scored a 17-month high. Coupled with GDP data posting a 1.1% gain for GDP the year has begun with a bang.Sadly the same cannot be said for the long-running saga for control of Fraser & Neave after the Thais continue their frustrating game of cat and mouse with OUE.Yesterday TCC simply extended its deadline yet again without improving its $8.88 a share offer disappointing market watchers. With OUE’s own deadline today it seems highly unlikely it will improve its own $9.08 a share offering.F&N’s share price edged down yesterday on the lack of news out of the Charoen camp and could see some fizz taken out of it again if no improved offer materialises this week. A severe lack of conviction for rival bidders now has F&N shareholders questioning their real motives.Today in Singapore we’ll look to push further above the 3200 level, which had been a looming barrier at the end of 2012.

"Property stocks suffer sharp falls Investors react to the latest cooling measures.OCBC Investment Research said:The mixed reactions on Wall Street overnight are unlikely to provide any inspiration for the local bourse this morning. Meanwhile, the STI continued to display resilience; despite losing as much as 1% intraday yesterday, the index rebounded to close above the 3200 psychological level with just a 0.3% loss.And with today’s tone likely to remain muted, we could see the index drifting within a tight band between the 3230 immediate resistance and the 3200 immediate base.Beyond that, the subsequent hurdle lies at the 3280 resistance (key peak in Jan ’11) with the subsequent base at the 3150 resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Property stocks took a battering yesterday in reaction to the government’s latest cooling measures and they may not be out of the woods yet.The likes of Capitaland, Keppel Land and City Developments all suffered sharp falls yesterday as Singapore digested the latest round of curbs designed to take the heat out of the property market.While yesterday’s price action for property counters, and to some extent the country’s big three banks, could be classified as a knee-jerk reaction there could be a more long-term shift at play.The property sector was the best performer last year, rising an impressive 48%, and was tipped for another buoyant year. But hikes in stamp duty levies and tightening of mortgage finance have seriously dampened its prospects for another bumper year.Investors are now fearing the property market could seriously slowdown in terms of transaction volume as a result of the latest government intervention. Property stocks have been tipped to fall by as much as 15% by some doomsayers while prices could fall up to 10%.Some feel the rise in the ABSD for foreign buyers is overdone given they represent less than 10% of overall property sales. However, foreigners do make up about 30% of high-end property sales, which are likely to take a battering now.And further property cooling measures cannot be ruled out, especially while the low interest rate environment encourages property speculation.With those words of caution investors should also remember the diverse nature of the portfolios and operations of these property players, many with a regional and global focus. So while Singapore is a significant part of their business it is not perhaps as pivotal to the overall fortunes of the company as many local investors initially feel.This doom over property stocks dragged the STI down 0.3% yesterday and it could test the 3200 threshold today, starting the day at 3206.

"STI set for flat open This could be a day of consolidation, says IG Markets Singapore.OCBC Investment Research said:The pullback on Wall Street overnight could spark profit-taking ahead of the weekend, especially after the recent strong gains (STI was up 0.7% yesterday, also up nearly 10% since 16 Nov).Sentiment is also likely cautious ahead of the key US jobs report later tonight.As before, market does look quite overbought and investors could be looking for an excuse to take profit; but we still see any move to take some money off the table as healthy. On the downside, we peg the immediate support at 3200, though we expect bargain hunting to kick in well before the next 3150 support.On the upside, 3230 is likely to hold (yesterday’s intraday high was 3231), while the next cap is likely at 3259 (May 08 high). Meanwhile, high-beta plays (cyclical commodities etc) and other situational small caps are likely to remain in play.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The STI rose 0.7% yesterday to put more distance between itself and the 3200 threshold.

In Europe the FTSE 100 gained 1% while the DAX rocketed 2.2%.This upbeat mood across Western markets is likely to spill over into Asia today.

"Significant improvement unlikely for STI On Friday the index traded sideways pretty much of the session before closing just 0.1% higher, says OCBC Investment Research.OCBC Investment Research said:The mixed reactions on Wall Street last Friday night and the weak Nikkei start (down 0.2% now) are unlikely to provide any positive cues for the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI had a rather muted session last Friday; following a 0.2% lower opening, the index traded sideways pretty much of the session before closing just 0.1% higher.And with today's tone unlikely to see any significant improvement, we could see the index continue its consolidation around current levels with the immediate obstacle still capped at the 3100 immediate resistance (upper limit of gap resistance).Beyond that, the subsequent obstacle lies at the 3140-3172 gap resistance. On the downside, the immediate support can be found at the 3020 minor trough, followed by the next base at the 2980 recent troughs. IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Singapore traders will be hoping to move on from last week’s mixed bag of local economic news to focus on a slew of data out of the world’s biggest economy this week.The Singapore economy was very much in focus with revised GDP and export figures released last Friday.The STI has powered ahead more than 15% this year, although this has not been in a straight line.But much of this stellar performance, when the global economic recovery hangs in the balance, has been thanks to the confidence in the local economy. But Friday’s data showed some cracks starting to appear in the solid ship called the Singapore economy.As growth shrank by 0.7% during the last quarter, exports also took a tumble dropping 3.3%, on a quarter-on-quarter basis. But it is not all bad news as in the first half of the year exports are actually up 5% compared to the same period last year.While the economy and stock market stand head and shoulders above many other developed economies during this difficult period, we would be naïve to think there wouldn’t be some repercussions.On a stock-specific level we were reminded of this by Genting which has long been the darling of the local traders with stellar gains from its Resorts World casino.It saw Q2 net profits plummet 32% while its share price is down 15% so far this year.",0.12185665220022202,0.8422723412513733,0.03587095066905022
"STI set for lower open The index is expected to come in around 0.5% lower.IG Markets Singapore noted:Weekend releases showed that the Chinese Trade Balance was better than expected at $27.7 billion in September, consensus had expected $20.7 billion and August's data had $26.7 billion.Exports in September grew 9.9% from a year earlier, roughly twice the 5.0% expected by investors and a marked increase from the 2.7% annual rise seen in August. Imports rose 2.4% year-on-year in September, in line with expectations which had forecast a recovery from August's 2.6% annual decline, which surprised the market last month.As this data is digested we could have expected to see a slightly firmer start to the week for risk assets. The aussie, as ever closely linked to the fortunes of China's resource hungry economy, initially moved higher than where it closed for the weekend. However that move was short lived and equities are currently marginally weaker.Friday's session in the US saw equities finish the week on a soft note and risk currencies drift lower, finishing the day flat and well off from their early highs.Friday's US data releases saw Michigan consumer sentiment survey print better than expected but that did little to lift the mood.In energy markets the tug of war between the fundamentals of slowing global demand and the tension in the Middle East continues to play out, with International Energy Agency reducing its forecast for global demand in 2012 and 2013.Data released last week also showed that crude supplies rose in the US and this seems to be a trend that may continue as both US and Middle East production is on the increase, while the slow growth will mean muted demand for the black gold continues.The main themes for this week are likely to be focused around the EU summit, which starts on Thursday in Brussels, with many hoping for further developments from the region on the situations for both Greece and Spain. However, it is unlikely we will see much in the way of progress at this meeting.This is despite the fresh impetus given to the region from the somewhat surprising award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU on Friday.In awarding the prize the talk was focussed on the unity and the achievements over the last 60 years, seemingly dismissing the current crisis and other issues that the union has failed to prevent in its tenure.While at times a difficult and imperfect union it is worth remembering the two World Wars the emanated from the region at the start of the twentieth century and the relative peace since.However, the effects of the current crisis has the potential to be as dangerous and far reaching as any war and we are in no means out of the woods yet. With leaders’ decision making being called in to question throughout the crisis and many suggesting not enough was done at the start, the decision to award the region a Nobel Peace Prize is seen by many as strange.For that reason this award might in fact do more to unite the euro skeptics than the union itself.We are currently looking at a lower open in Singapore, with STI expected to come in around 0.5% lower.",0.11473142355680466,0.8627840876579285,0.022484416142106056

"F&N's Heineken dilemma raises shareholder's hackles Japanese drinks giant Kirin explores its options on its 15% stake in F&N.F&N shares closed at SGD8.35 on 25 July (the highest close since 2006), even as its board seeks advice on Heineken’s offer to buy out its stake in Asia Pacific Breweries. Meanwhile, Kirin, which holds a 15% stake in F&N, has engaged an investment bank to evaluate its options in light of the recent corporate action at F&N.Here's more from Nomura:We see three possible scenarios for Kirin:1) Do nothing: Kirin could wait and see if Heineken’s offer will be put for a vote. If the shareholders of F&N vote in favour of selling the APB stake to Heineken, we think Kirin could work with Thai Bev to grow the remaining non-beer businesses within F&N and perhaps unlock value by divesting the property business. We believe a similar argument applies if shareholders decide to keep the APB shares within the group.2) Sell its stake in F&N: As Kirin’s entry price for its 15% stake in F&N is SGD6.50 (acquired in July 2010), it would likely record a nice gain if it were to decide to sell out, preferably closer to SGD8.88, which is Thai Bev’s cost when it acquired the 22% stake in F&N from the OCBC group.3) Making a general offer: Kirin could choose to launch a voluntary conditional general offer for F&N at say SGD9.00 (slightly above Thai Bev’s price paid for F&N of SGD8.88) and take control of the F&N group with the view of owning the F&B assets for the longer term. Based on SGD9 per share, the market cap of F&N would be SGD12.8bn, which would be costly, in our view. However, Kirin could also look to divest the property business which is worth about SGD6bn based on our estimates to reduce its outlay for F&N. Assuming Kirin is prepared to sell F&N’s APB stake, Heineken’s SGD50 per share offer for APB provides a back stop valuation at SGD5.2bn for the APB stake, based on our estimates.",0.12215898931026459,0.014433961361646652,0.8634070158004761

"18 listed firms likely to receive privatisation offers M1 is on the list; check out other big names.A flurry of privatisation has gripped the Singapore market of late. It was the Asian consumer franchises that started the corporate actions. Next, bombed-out cyclical coal stocks went the route of privatisation as well.According to CIMB, stocks have generally ended up more than 20% higher on such buyouts. As such, CIMB thinks the wave might go on.""We believe that globally, corporates have been building up cash to prepare for the worst, ever since Global Financial Crisis. They have the means to make an offer. With Asian consumer businesses among the few structurally-growing units in the world, the initial battle for Asia Pacific Breweries and privatisation of Cerebos were not surprising. The surprise was when coal stocks like Sakari Resources joined the fray. Sakari had been battered-down in recent weeks on ugly short-term prospects, but obviously, buyers had a longer-term perspective. Positioning for more of such corporate actions, we sift the market for stocks trading below -1SD valuations to their historical trading ranges, plus the shareholders with both the interest and means to de-list them,"" it said.Who to see offers next?CIMB thinks that stocks that might receive privatisation offers include the following:The screening processCIMB went through a 2-stage process to screen stocks quantitatively and qualitatively.It's first screen is a quantitative screen, selecting for stocks that are trading below -1SD of their P/BV or P/E trading bands.CIMB reckons that key characteristics that could trigger privatisation attempts include:1)valuations below 1x P/BV or replacement values;2) high net cash on balance sheets;3) single shareholders with deep-enough pockets plus desire to control the entire entities;4) high existing ownership by major shareholders; and5) little need for the companies to tap capital markets for funds in the near future.",0.06987909972667694,0.02537689357995987,0.9047439694404602

There is a strong chance the purpose of the bid is to scupper Heineken's bid to acquire Asia Pacific Breweries. Whatever its intentions, it will definitely create some uncertainty among F&N shareholders as they head to the September 28 EGM.ThaiBev have been a bit secretive in what their true intentions are and this bid sheds no real light on what these are. Thai Bev may still want to sell F&N’s APB share to Heineken and use the money to purchase F&N and then break it up. They also may want to take control of F&N to stop it selling its APB stake to Heineken. Both scenarios have equal probability.There has been talk of ThaiBev now being interested in the non-beverage side of F&N as it owns more than $8 billion of properties and hospitality ventures. If it took control of F&N it would probably want to break the conglomerate up and sell it off.But we still think ThaiBev is more interested in the alcoholic business of F&N, of which APB is the jewel in the crown. It would hate to see Heineken gain control of this and increase its foothold in Asia at ThaiBev’s expense.Also likely to be in focus today is Genting, who could come under pressure today after the Singapore casino was fined for breaching safeguards.

In any case, we note that the index managed to make a pretty good rebound off the key 3040 support (50-DMA and centre of Bollinger Band) over the past two sessions, suggesting that the immediate outlook remains somewhat positive.So unless the STI triggers the parabolic sell signal at 3009, it should continue to inch higher towards 3088 (recent high), before being capped by the upper Bollinger Band at 3098 (also close to 3100 psychological barrier).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In Singapore the main event will be the F&N EGM to vote on its sale of APB to Heineken. There have been many twists in this saga and few would bet against one or two more until a deal goes ahead and the future of F&N is assured.A Japanese business paper has reported that Kirin plans to sell its 15% stake in F&N to the Thais.

The Thais probably favour two options over this – holding onto the soft drink business or selling it off via a bidding war involving the likes of Coca Cola.The final concern for Charoen is whether to honour the $4 billion capital reduction that F&N announced once the APB sale goes head.Shareholders may demand this is agreed by any new owners, and of course ThaiBev will be one of the beneficiaries of this windfall as an APB shareholder.But Charoen may be looking at ways of keeping this cash within the business which further down the line may fund the expansion of his expanding empire.So while the Dutch-Thai truce has answered one question over the future of APB, there are still many questions surrounding the future of F&N.The futures market is pointing to a flat open for the STI this morning.",0.2520136833190918,0.5078468322753906,0.24013951420783997

As a recap, the STI slipped for the second consecutive session yesterday with a 0.5% loss after failing to overcome the 2800 resistance recently.But as sentiment could continue to remain cautious ahead of the election in Greece this weekend, 2800 could remain a stiff resistance to clear in the near term.Meanwhile, we still see the immediate support at around 2735 (minor trough), with the subsequent base lying at the 2700 level (major trough in Jun '12).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Spain is politely waiting in the wings to become the next nation in crisis once Greece leaves centre stage. The problem is Greece is in no hurry to step out of the limelight having hogged it for so long with its faltering economy, successive bailout rescues, failed elections and crippling government debt. While markets have been preoccupied by the near Greek tragedy, bigger problems have been creeping up the agenda on the eurozone danger list. Spain is making a very strong case to top the list.Having seen widespread downgradings of it banks and economy and a €100 billion bailout package the Spanish pain continues with another downgrading by Moodys which leaves its borrowing costs above 7%.With Italy not far behind, markets can’t breathe a sigh of relief even if the Greek election sees a pro-bailout government elected.Angela Merkel has talked about Europe being in a race with the markets. It looks like European leaders have stopped for a water break and some in-fighting while the markets sprint ahead of them.This made for a weak session across European bourses as investors looked dimly on the lack of clear direction from policymakers. Ironically the Athens stock market was up 10% on speculation that pro-bailout parties were gaining ground and the EU was ready to renegotiate the terms of the second bailout package.Wall Street was on the receiving end of more poor data last night with disappointing jobless claims following on from weak retail sales on Wednesday. But the talk on trading floors is growing that monetary policy easing will be urgently required to try to get the US economy back on track. This lifted US markets yesterday with the S&P 500 rising 1.1%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2% while the NASDAQ gained 0.5%.

The STI dropped more than 2%, its biggest fall since last November.We could be in for a repeat performance today as Greece’s left-wing political party talked of ripping up its “barbarous” austerity programme which underpinned its second bailout package. This battle cry sent European markets in a tailspin as risk-on trading ran for cover. The CAC 40 plummeted 2.8%, the DAX dropped 1.9% while the FTSE 100 fell 1.8%.Wall Street also felt the cold winds of eurozone meltdown blow across the Atlantic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6% while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ both ended 0.4% lower. The markets seem to already be pricing in a messy Greek exit and don’t hold much hope of a resolution being reached with such defiant talk of reneging on the IMF/EU deal. The left-wing party secured the second highest number of votes at the weekend and are likely to play a major part in the new Greek parliament.So all the efforts to rescue Greece with two bailout packages and secure funding after months of tense negotiations look like they might come undone like a badly knitted jumper.Some observers are putting the chances of a Greek exit from the euro at 90%. Whatever percentages you are working on the damage has already been done to Greece with regards to its international reputation.It’s not the fact that Greece might exit the euro that is causing concern but the wider effect on the eurozone and further fallouts, particularly from peripheral economies.And the Greek resistance sends out a very unhealthy message to these members that running away from your debts is a viable option instead of signing up to a tough and unpopular austerity measures.",0.009830606169998646,0.9711407423019409,0.019028587266802788

"STI snaps two-day losing streak Property stocks were among the favoured counters with CapitaMalls Asia rising 2.5% and CapitaLand ending 1.9% higher.IG Markets Singapore said (for 15 June 2012 trading):The STI shot up 1.3% today to clock in some healthy gains ahead of a potentially volatile start to next week once the Greek elections have taken place.This snaps a two-day losing streak although today’s gains were fuelled by talk of G20 central banks drawing up an action plan for a Greek fallout rather than a genuine shift in sentiment.Asian markets were on the whole cautious in trading ahead of the monumental elections that could change the face of the eurozone on Sunday. Local traders were also lifted by hopes the Fed may launch another round of quantitative easing which saw Wall Street rally last night. Asian traders picked up the baton this morning and put their eurozone woes behind them for a few hours.On the local market, property stocks were among the favoured counters with CapitaMalls Asia rising 2.5% and CapitaLand ending 1.9% higher. This comes despite new private homes sales tumbling 32% last month compared to April’s figures.There is growing speculation the government may introduce more property-cooling measures and is targeting shoebox apartments next.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs May 3, 2012 Traders sentiment was downbeat with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.1% at 13269 and the S&P 0.3% lower at 1402.OCBC Investment Research said:The mixed reactions on Wall Street overnight and the mildly positive Nikkei start (+0.3% now) are unlikely to provide any significant inspiration to the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the index built on Monday's upside momentum and initiated a fairly strong recovery yesterday; following a 0.3% higher opening, the index recovered steadily to a 0.9% gain and closed at its intraday high.But with the 3010 immediate resistance lying just around the corner, the index could potentially face some near term resistance for now. Should this obstacle be cleared, the subsequent key resistance lies at 3030 (various key peaks).On the downside, the immediate support remains at 2946 (recent trough), followed by the vital base at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Maybe the old adage of selling in May and going away still holds some weight as markets took a tumble last night due to weaker US employment print and slumping eurozone factory activity.It had looked like a bout of May momentum was gathering pace with firmer US and Chinese manufacturing output ushering in the start of the month. But ADP figures showing US employment rose by 119,000, compared to an expected 177,000 soon burst the bubble.Bleak eurozone unemployment data also did its bit to remind traders that any global recovery will not be in a straight line but instead a road filled with potholes and sharp bends.On Wall Street last night the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1% at 13269. The S&P was 0.3% lower at 1402, while the NASDAQ added 0.3% to finish at 3060.Risk off sentiment was firmly back on the table with such poor unemployment numbers from the eurozone as they hit record lows among member states. The ECB meets later today although no change in interest rates or monetary easing is expected.But the pressure is on policymakers to act as the eurozone slides closer to a recession, which may be a prolonged one given the very high unemployment rates and severity of budget cuts to be introduced.A flight to safety saw inflows to the US dollar and German bunds, which fell to a new low of 1.6%.In Asia today we are likely to see a spill-over of this downbeat sentiment among traders. Once again, investors are calling into question the strength of a US recovery which plays such a determining role for the rest of the global economy.",0.019513467326760292,0.9608099460601807,0.019676484167575836
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri May 4, 2012 A weaker open is expected for the STI following the retreat on Wall Street.OCBC Investment Research said:The retreat on Wall Street overnight is likely to cue the local bourse to a similar pullback this morning. The Japanese market is closed for holiday today.As a recap, the STI turned mildly negative yesterday following Wednesday's sharp recovery; despite recovering as much as 0.2% at one point, the index reversed south to a 0.2% loss at the close.And with the index failing its retest at the 3010 immediate resistance in the last session, we could potentially see it slipping further today in the direction of the 2946 (recent trough) support again.Beyond the 3010 obstacle, the subsequent key resistance still lies at 3030 (various key peaks). On the downside, the next vital base is located at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Singapore’s factory output for April showed a surprise contraction but should do little to unsettle traders as the economy is still looking resilient.While last month’s PMI figure slipped from 50.2 to 49.7 it hid the fact that new orders rose and the core electronics sector was healthy. There are also question marks as to how closely it tracks the pharmaceutical sector – which has seen stellar growth this year.While the figures should do little to dampen spirits among local investors, there is plenty more to worry about within the global economy.For example, what is likely to weigh on traders’ minds this morning is more disappointing data out of the US. Last night, a report showed the key services sector slowed more than forecast leading to losses on Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5% at 13207 while the S&P was 0.8% lower at 1402.While quarter one saw a slew of upbeat economic data from the world’s biggest economy in terms of job creation, manufacturing activity and consumer confidence, the tables have turned this quarter.Increasingly weak metrics are being released to raise serious doubts about the US economy’s recovery. One thing is for sure – if it is a recovery it is beginning to look like a snail crossing the road.This slow stance is likely to be supported tonight with non-farm payroll data showing a much smaller increase in job creation than expected. Economists are already downgrading their estimates after Wednesday’s ADP employment numbers and last night’s slippage in the services sector.The ECB met last night to discuss interest rates and as expected kept rates on hold. But the euro edged up against the dollar as no doveish tones were present. It currently sits at $1.315.ECB president Mario Draghi predicts an economic recovery in the eurozone in the second half of the year. Perhaps he is privy to data we aren’t, as based on the latest manufacturing, unemployment and government debt figures an economic recovery looks a lot further down the line.But Asia is taking a leaf out of the eurozone’s book and increasing its own emergency funds to protect against a European financial crisis. China, Japan and South Korea (known as Asean+3) are to double the size of the emergency find to S$300 billion.On the commodities markets, oil prices have softened after a series of poor economic data from the US and Europe coupled with a big rise in US crude stocks.With political tensions starting to ease, the spotlight has been on fundamentals to keep oil at these inflated prices. But economic data as of late has been disappointing and tonight’s non-farm payrolls figures aren’t expected to break this trend.WTI crude has slipped 2.6% to $102.54 on growth concerns and increased inventories. Brent now trades at $116.07, which is well off the highs it saw last quarter when it was routinely trading above $125 a barrel.In Singapore today, the local banks could be in focus. OCBC has just been named the world’s strongest bank for the second year running, according to Bloomberg Markets magazine.DBS, Southeast Asia’s biggest bank, has announced it is to sell 500 million yuan of bonds in China today via three-year AAA-rated notes yielding 4.5%.The quieter one of the three, UOB, will be in focus next week when it releases its Q1earnings.The futures market points to a weaker open for the STI this morning as its 3000 level status is likely to come under pressure.",0.013820482417941093,0.9653341770172119,0.020845312625169754
"STI forecast to open weak after eight consecutive days of gains A potential technical correction is expected in the near term.OCBC Investment Research said:The more than 1% retreat on Wall Street last Friday night and the poor Nikkei start (down 1.6% now) are likely to spook the local bourse to a pessimistic opening this morning.Following the 0.2% higher close on Friday, the STI has already registered eight consecutive sessions of gains; this sets the stage for a potential technical correction in the days ahead.With the odds of a pullback increasing significantly now, we could see the index heading back to the 2950 resistance-turned-support. Below that, the next key support lies at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.On the upside, the immediate resistance is now pegged at the 3000 key psychological obstacle, with the subsequent key resistance lying at the 3030 key peaks.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Generally, the second half of the year has seen a pretty solid start with the euphoria of the EU summit and moves by various central banks to bolster their respective economies.However, many investors are of the view that these measures will have little positive impact and that the second half of the year will be much the same as the first - a constant grind with the same issues preventing the market from any material gains. Just as Andy Murray was never likely to win Wimbledon, investors never really expected the crisis to be solved after one EU summit. Spanish yields creeping back up towards 7% is evidence of that.The STI has enjoyed eight straight days of gains as it confounded critics with its steady rise to 2978 on Friday.

"STI rebounds to close almost 1.3% higher The index gained due to Wall Street’s strong session, growing talk of fresh stimulus for the Chinese economy, and some early window-dressing, says IG Markets Singapore.OCBC Investment Research said:The continued recovery on Wall Street overnight and the strong Nikkei start (up 1.2% now) are likely to inspire the local bourse to further gains this morning.As a recap, the STI had already showed some positive signs yesterday; it rebounded again at the 2800 psychological support to close nearly 1.3% higher.And with today's tone likely to remain optimistic, we could see the index testing the 2862 immediate resistance; this as the subsequent vital obstacle lies at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance.On the downside, the immediate base is still pegged at the 2800 psychological support, with the next support marked at the 2760 minor trough.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The US housing markets is proving to be an unlikely saviour for eurozone-jaded traders this week with more positive data.Last night firmer US economic data lifted Wall Street and Europe with orders for durable goods and American home-buying figures coming in better-than-expected.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, the NASDAQ lifted 0.6% while the S&P 500 gained 0.9%. This has helped take investors’ minds off the expected disappointment of the EU summit which starts today.European markets were also in a positive mood with the FTSE 100 gaining 1.4% while the DAX put on 1.5%. This has helped paper over the cracks in the eurozone for another session as Spanish debt worries took a back seat.Yesterday Case-Shiller data showed a rise in US house prices for the third consecutive month which helped boost markets globally. Today they may again be lifted by more positive economic data from the world’s biggest economy.The STI gained an impressive 1.3% yesterday through a combination of Wall Street’s strong session, growing talk of fresh stimulus for the Chinese economy and some early window-dressing as Q2 comes to a close.Traders will be looking for more clues from China as to the “more proactive” policies it may be introducing to ensure growth.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs April 5, 2012 Thursday is not looking good for the STI with Japan and Australian stock markets opening weaker amidst Wall Street and European declines.IG Markets Singapore said:While it may be Good Friday tomorrow it is shaping up to be Bad Thursday today after another night of heavy selling from liquidity-starved traders. The downplaying of QE3 in Tuesday night’s Fed minutes is still having reverberations across US markets with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both suffering falls of 1%.The NASDAQ fared even worse dropping 1.5% last night. It seems traders were thinking they could have their cake and eat it – enjoy a global economic recovery while central banks continued to flood the markets with cheap money.But European traders have sweeter teeth judging by how far markets tumbled. The FTSE plummeted 2.3% while the DAX dropped 2.8% as traders slipped out the back door taking their 2012 rally profits with them.This heavy selloff leaves observers wondering just how much of this year’s rally was driven by liquidity, and hopes of further central bank largesse, rather than a recovering global economy and the eurozone contagion being contained.While equity markets took a pummelling gold fell 1.5% to $1,620 as it was likely to be one of the main beneficiaries of QE3 funding. This is its lowest level since January and could question the bullish outlook for the precious metal.One retreat that can't be questioned is that of oil prices which fell by a not insignificant amount. US crude dropped 2.4% to $101.47 a barrel while Brent dipped to $122.45.US crude stockpiles have risen by their biggest amount in more than 10 years while extra production is coming from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Libya and Iraq. Plus with growing talk of the release of strategic supplies it is clear supply side issue are being addressed.What is less clear is how tight supply has actually been during this Middle Eastern crisis which led to oil prices rising so high. Speculation and panic have played a significant part in oil’s recent rally.Assets linked to growth all had a tough night with copper falling 3.3% to $3.79 a pound, silver dropping 4% to $31.32. while the Australian dollar also fell.The Eurozone crisis has crept back onto the agenda after Spain’s poor take-up of government bonds last night. As a consequence yields had to rise to get enough investors to buy the paper.All this negativity bodes badly for the STI which retreated 1% yesterday. After Wall Street and European declines we expect to see more copycat reactions from Asian traders.Already Japan and Australian stock markets have opened weaker this morning.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:The more than 1% correction on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start (-0.8% now) are likely to spook the local bourse to a negative opening as well this morning.The STI had shown further signs of weaknesses yesterday after breaching its 3-month uptrend support; following a 0.2% lower opening, the index retreated to a 1% loss by the close.And with today's tone likely to remain largely pessimistic, we could see the index breaking the 2975 immediate base (recent trough) before slipping further in the direction of the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.On the upside, 3030 remains the vital resistance to overcome in the near term, with the next obstacle pegged at the 3075 support-turned-resistance.",0.01279124803841114,0.967783510684967,0.01942523755133152
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs April 19, 2012 After breaking through the 3000 level, the STI is set for some downside following retreat on Wall Street and Nikkei’s poor start.OCBC Investment Research said:The retreat on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start (-0.8% now) are likely to weigh on local sentiments this morning.The STI had initiated a technical rebound yesterday after taking cue from the improving US market the prior night; after opening nearly 0.6% higher, the index held on to most of its earlier gains to close around 0.5% in the black.But with today's tone likely to turn more downside biased, we could see the index drifting lower this morning while being capped by the 3005 (recent minor peak) immediate resistance.Beyond that, the subsequent resistance still lies at the 3030 (key peaks) vital obstacle. On the downside, 2945 (recent minor trough) is still the immediate support, followed by the subsequent key base at the 2900 vital resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:While the STI broke through the 3000 level last night it faces a tough challenge to stay in this zone today after a choppy night on Wall Street and Europe.An unwelcome combination of sliding US tech stocks and Spanish debt jitters stopped further rallying on Wall Street and European markets.Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6% at 13033. The S&P was 0.4% lower at 1385, while the NASDAQ shed 0.4% to finish at 3031. But the sell-off may have been sparked by profit-takers in IBM and Intel positions causing to a short-term blip. However, it doesn’t bode well for Asian tech stocks today which rallied yesterday and helped regional bourses put on strong gains.Global markets also weren’t done any favours from Spain whose debt problems resurfaced following a spike in bad loans, as non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending jumped.This could lead to some nail-biting moments ahead of today’s 10-year bond auction, which is a litmus test for investor confidence towards Spain’s ability to service its debts.There are fears the eurozone could become the new Japan, suffering decades of virtually no growth and tumbling asset prices, if it survives the current crisis.Last night the FTSE 100 was down 0.4% while the DAX dropped 1%. The EUR has held steady against the USD sitting at $1.312. Almost two-thirds of IG Markets’ clients have taken short positions in the currency pair, as eurozone sentiment faces some tough days ahead.On the commodity markets, WTI crude slipped 1.5% to $102.67 as US stockpiles rose by more than double forecasts. Brent crude is little changed at $117.84. Global equities are in a holding pattern waiting for a new catalyst to spark a Q2 rally. With no clear signs of further central bank liquidity and unconvincing global economic data it’s hard to know where this spark will come from.This has led some large institutional investors to take money out of the markets and increase their cash holding, which is being mirrored by many local traders.However, traders may take heart from news that the STI has outperformed private property since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) according to figures from SGX. Its research shows the STI has gained 77% since the first quarter of 2009 compared with 47% for private property (based on URA’s Property Price Index).",0.01597532071173191,0.9650701880455017,0.018954552710056305
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues May 15, 2012 Japanese and Australian equities have already opened weaker following losses on Wall Street and the continued concern over Greece, and the STI is likely to feel the effects.OCBC Investment research said:The local bourse is likely to be spooked by renewed weakness on Wall Street overnight – note that the Nikkei opened 0.7% lower but is now 1.1% on worries over Greece.Although the STI already fell 0.7% yesterday, we could continue to see more profit-taking, especially since 2900 now appears to be a pretty tough hurdle to clear.As such, we could see the index slipping past the initial 2850 support towards 2800. Above 2900, the next barrier can be found at 2950.We expect defensive stocks to remain in focus, with yield plays close behind.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:It was a case of “same same but different” yesterday as continued fears of a Greek exit capped another dismal start to the week. It was a sea of red across Europe and Wall Street as investors try to assess what damage would be done if a new Greek government ripped up the terms of its debt agreement and was forced to leave the eurozone.Spain and Italy are greatly at risk of a Greek exit given their exposure to Greek debt and the fragile state of their economies and banking sectors. All this will weigh very heavily on the hearts and minds of traders this week as risk-on trading goes into hibernation.On Wall Street the S&P 500 and NASDAQ lost 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1%.In Europe it was close to carnage as the FTSE 100 plummeted 2%, the Dax 1.9% and the CAC 40 saw 2.3% of its value wiped off.Singapore caught the tail-end of Europe’s weak open yesterday as the STI dipped into the red during the last hour of trading.

"Wall Street retreats; Japanese markets open higher The STI started the day at 2779.1 after losing 1.5% on 18 May 2012.OCBC Investment Research said:Despite the retreat on Wall Street last Friday night, the positive Nikkei start (+0.7% now) is likely to offer some relief for the local bourse this morning.The STI, which ended 1.5% lower in the previous session, is hovering just above its long term 3-year uptrend support now.This could provide some firm support in the near term as the index looks likely to initiate a technical rebound and potentially close the 2789-2822 gap resistance today.Beyond that, the subsequent resistance can be found at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance. On the downside, the immediate support is pegged 2779 (Friday's intraday low), followed by the next support at 2740 (minor resistance-turned-support).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In Singapore, the STI finds itself starting the day at 2779.1 after losing 1.5% on Friday. The local market has given up almost 8% of the gains it achieved from its stellar first quarter and sadly this may not be the full extent of its losses.While bargain-hunting and buying on dips is recommended after such a heavy sell-off last week, some traders are anticipating more falls before they re-enter the market.However, the futures market is pointing to a firmer open for the STI today.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed May 2, 2012 Positive start is expected for the STI following strong manufacturing data from the US.IG Markets Singapore said:Singapore traders come back from a Labour Day holiday to find a welcome burst of optimism around global markets thanks to some strong US manufacturing data.The US purchasing managers’ index shot up to 54.8, having fallen last month to 53.4. While this headline figure is enough to revive hopes that the world’s biggest economy is still on the path to recovery, the small print reveals an even rosier picture.The PMI data also showed that new orders were strong and inventories were lower which points to manufacturing output remaining strong in the coming months.This positive news was a shot in the arm for US equities last night. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5% at 13279. The S&P was 0.6% higher at 1406, while the NASDAQ added 0.1% to finish at 3050. But traders may need more convincing that the recovery has legs, given the recent slew of downbeat economic data coming out of the US this second quarter. And there will be plenty of opportunity this week with ADP private employment data out tonight and non-farm payrolls data this Friday.In Asia, China manufacturing data also came in firmer which helped lift spirits among investors and negate some of the negativity swirling around Europe. A 50 basis point cut in Australia’s base rate boosted the local stock market.Commodity prices lifted with renewed hopes that a sustained global economic recovery is still achievable this year with oil one of the biggest movers. WTI crude rose 1.2% to $106.16 a barrel although Brent was unchanged at $119.36.Oil traders are much more focused on the state of the economy rather than geopolitical tensions in the Middle East which continue to drag on. The better-than-expected manufacturing figures come after a series of disappointing data and the surprise among investors is evident across commodities and risk assets.RBS meanwhile noted (for 1 May 2012 trading):An initial rally turned into a bear steepening after better than expected ISM data boosted risk assets, reversed the recent trend of data misses, and took the shine off Treasury securities that have spent three days hovering near key resistances.The initial bid was partly attributed to a rally in Gilts, and the fact that with Europe closed investors bought TY heavily as they could not buy bunds. There certainly were early block trades to support this notion. Our flows were real money 10s30s flatteners, real money paying in 5s, bank type selling in 3s and 5s, and some other real money buying in 7s.In TIPS we saw better buying of 10s and selling of 30s early on and better selling of the belly later in the day, all from real money. There were mixed front end flows throughout the day. Total Treasury broker volume today was 115% of the 10-day average.Today's selloff cements the technical bearish disposition for daily momentum. Tactical shorts initiated over the last few days should feel more comfortable that the correction can gain some legs, and longer term investors should continue to exhibit patience in putting cash to work.",0.9297536015510559,0.050473831593990326,0.019772572442889214
"STI down 0.6%, set for weak opening A slide into the red for the rest of the week looks on the cards for the STI, says IG Markets Singapore.Here’s more from IG Markets Singapore:The crisis in the eurozone slipped from very bad to worse last night as Spanish and Italian yields edged up and the euro fell to a new low as confidence fades further.A disjointed approach to how eurozone policymakers are handling the crisis has seen confidence slowly ebb away. Investors are still willing to put their hard-earned cash in the dwindling returns of German bunds and US treasuries even though they have hit record lows. Safety is the new game in town as traders decide the risks are too high keeping it in risk assets like eurozone equities and the single currency.Last night the euro fell below the $1.24 level last night as another worrying sign of negative sentiment. Italian bonds joined the hall of shame for nations with bond yields now above 6% which dented the single currency.Pressure on EU ministers to do something to restore confidence is building rapidly. This may involve the ECB stepping in to buy Italian and Spanish bonds but it definitely doesn’t involve recapitalising Spanish banks.After a positive couple of days the rug has abruptly been pulled on this week's mini rally by the doom and gloom circulating the eurozone and the lack of good news out of the world’s two biggest economies. Traders took weak US housing starts badly as the benchmark S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. Elsewhere on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% while the NASDAQ lost 1.2% as traders fled risk assets.The carnage continued in Europe with the FTSE100 down 1.7%, the DAX losing 1.8% and the CAC 40 plummeting 2.2%.Markets had sand kicked in their face yesterday from China which poured cold water on rumours it could be launching a massive spending spree to revitalise the economy. Asian markets took this badly as the one glimmer of hope for a week of gains sank without trace.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:Renewed weakness on Wall Street overnight and the very poor Nikkei start (down 2% now) could send the local bourse into a similar tailspin today.Though the STI is already down 0.6% yesterday, a break below 2770 (61.8% retracement of 2606-3035 rally) could see the index returning to 2600 levels.Below 2770, the next support is at 2755 but the firmer one is lower at 2705.

"STI set for weak open amidst 'economic despair' in Asia The STI ended on 1 June 2012 at 2745.7, down more than 9% on its March high.IG Markets Singapore said:Only central banks can save us now. That seems to be the underlying message as market turmoil continues as the world’s major economies falter and flirt with recession.Friday’s disappointing non-farm payrolls figures capped another dismal week for global equities as markets were already digesting poor Chinese manufacturing data and fear of implosion in the eurozone.Investors reacted badly to a weak print of 69,000 for US job creation when a much larger number of 150,000 was expected.This latest disappointment hammers home that the strong payroll numbers we saw in the first quarter were merely a false dawn. They were a flash in the pan buoyed by warm weather and not a sign that the US economy was powering back into growth mode.This realisation sent investors running for the exit on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2%, its biggest one-day drop since last December. The S&P 500 plummeted 2.5% while the NASDAQ fell 2.8%.No-one is looking forward to the opening of Asian markets this morning with the prospects of some hefty falls ahead. After China’s downbeat manufacturing data last week, today starts with more negative news as non-manufacturing output comes in at 55.2, down from 56.1 in April.The STI ended Friday at 2745.7, down more than 9% on its March high when it broke through the 3,000 level. With such dark clouds of economic despair hanging over Asia the 2700 level is likely to be tested this week.OCBC Investment research meanwhile noted:The more than 2% plunge on Wall Street last Friday night and the poor Nikkei start (-2.1% now) are likely to spook the local bourse to a sharp retreat as well this morning.As a recap, the STI had already showed signs of breaking its long term uptrend support in the previous session with a 1% lower close.And with today's tone likely to remain very pessimistic, we could see the index sinking towards the 2690 (minor trough) immediate support, as the subsequent base lies at the 2650 support (next minor trough).On the upside, 2760 is now the newly established support-turned-resistance, with the subsequent obstacle pegged at 2830 minor peak.",0.008838574402034283,0.972551167011261,0.018610287457704544
"STI set for firmer open despite retreat on Wall Street The mildly positive Nikkei start and significantly higher US index futures are expected to provide some lift.OCBC Investment Research said:Despite the retreat on Wall Street last Friday night, the significantly higher US index futures (+0.6% on average) and the mildly positive Nikkei start (+0.4% now) are likely to cue the local bourse to a positive opening this morning.As such, the STI which registered a 0.2% lower close in the last session could continue to find a relatively strong support at its 3-year long term uptrend line.For now, the immediate resistance is still pegged at the 2799-2812 gap resistance formed recently, as the next obstacle lies at the 2831 minor peak.On the downside, the immediate support is now marked at 2763 (recent trough), with the subsequent base found at the 2730 minor resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The talk of the town, well city, seems to be when to re-enter the market after such sharp falls this month. While the STI has lost 7% of its value this month amid fears of a Greek exit many traders are sitting on the side lines waiting to pick up some bargains. But there are plenty still fearful of further drops with so much uncertainty still prevalent within Europe.Have markets priced in most of the downside or is there still more to come? This question is difficult to answer given the uncertainty and unprecedented situation we find ourselves in. This almost answers the question itself pointing out that there is likely to be more stormy weather ahead.In the meantime, it calls for defensive action with cautious investors opting for solid dividend payers and favourite blue chip stocks that have been indiscriminately sold off in the panic selling.This week, traders are gearing up for more of the same risk-off sentiment with no obvious game-changing announcement or event expected in the days ahead.",0.14504960179328918,0.8119666576385498,0.04298366233706474
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon April 23, 2012 Corporate earnings beat analysts’ expectations and lifted US markets, while the IMF pledged an extra US$430 billion to help fight the debt crisis in Europe.OCBC Investment Research said:The mildly higher Wall Street close last Friday and the positive Nikkei start (+0.6% now) could provide a mild lift to the STI this morning.However, market could continue to remain indecisive, given that the STI still looks uncomfortable staying above 3000 level.Daily technical indicators continue to suggest a slightly more downside bias for now.The STI looks boxed in by a triangle formation, with the top boundary at 3009; the bottom at 2997.But we note that a strong buy signal would be generated around 2950, which is also close to the lower Bollinger band. Expect the recent highs at 3033 to cap near-term upside.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Singapore equities are set for a cautious start this morning with no strong leads from Wall Street and Europe at the end of last week and plenty of macroeconomic pointers in the days ahead.Friday finished on a more positive note, however, as US markets were lifted by more corporate earnings beating analysts’ expectations while in Europe the IMF pledged an extra US$430 billion to help fight the eurozone debt crisis.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5% at 13029. The S&P was 0.1% higher at 1379, while the NASDAQ shed 0.2% to finish at 3000. Markets were buoyed by strong revenues from the likes of Mcdonald’s, GE and Microsoft.In Europe, traders have been distracted by the French elections which have added a layer of uncertainty on top of Spanish debt woes and general unease about a eurozone meltdown and years of recession.In Asia this morning we have HSBC’s manufacturing flash PMI figures which is likely to lead to some cautious trading ahead of the announcement. This is normally a pretty significant event risk, particularly at a time when China growth concerns continue to be a hot topic. The previous reading was 48.3 and any major moves north of this figure could result in a boost of confidence.Anything south of last month’s number and pressure mounts for a PBOC cut to the RRR borrowing rate. In Singapore this lunchtime we have consumer price figures for March. Inflation eased slightly to 4.6% in February down from 4.8% at the start of the year and the Monetary Authority of Singapore will be hoping the downward trend continues.But considering the MAS is speeding up the appreciation of the Singapore dollar to tackle inflation, it doesn’t expect consumer prices to come down drastically anytime soon.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon April 30, 2012 Coming from a volatile week, the STI is not expected to show significant climb with the upcoming holiday likely to affect momentum.OCBC Investment Research said:Despite the firmer Wall Street close Friday, we are unlikely to see any significant rise in the STI, especially ahead of the holiday tomorrow.We further note that the current interest continues to be focused on speculative plays, especially the penny stocks; hence giving rise to concerns that the market may appear to be “frothy”.As such, the index could continue to face stiff resistance in trying to clear the 3000 psychological hurdle.Having said that, any pullback towards 2950 could entice some buying interest.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Asian bourses face a choppy week as a slew of public holidays across the region may break up market momentum.China and Japan are among the markets closed today while Labour Day is widely celebrated across the region tomorrow. But for those markets open today there are few leads to go on from Friday night’s Wall Street and European sessions.Last week did finish on a positive note despite some bearish tones from a Spanish downgrade and some weak economic data namely US GDP figures which missed the mark.This sort of setback would have traders running for cover but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 ended up 0.2% higher while the NASDAQ climbed 0.6%. Because softer economic data is peppered with the prospects of more central bank liquidity no wide scale panic set in about the strength of the recovery from the world’s biggest economy.In these times even the downside has an upside. But bulls were also taking heart last week from the strong US corporate earnings which is not just about Apple.The STI had a fairly volatile week although Friday saw some calm return as the index stayed unchanged. With a public holiday tomorrow trading volumes are expected to be light.But last week we saw unusually high trading volumes in a few penny stocks which seem to operate in their own little world oblivious to the macroeconomic factors affecting the blue chips.The allure of these stocks, which often see wild swings in the share prices, is a hard habit to break. But much of the excitement is created by a handful of traders who ramp up the share price, watch it rise further as innocent investors come on board and then dump the stock.",0.418997585773468,0.4992770254611969,0.0817253589630127
"STI to slip further following almost 0.5% loss The index could fall towards its 3-week uptrend support, says OCBC Investment Research.OCBC Investment Research said:The more than 1% retreat on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start (down 0.4% now) are likely to dampen local sentiments this morning.As such, the STI which fell nearly 0.5% yesterday could slip further towards its 3-week uptrend support and 2800 immediate support for a test today.Should these supports be breached, we could see the index falling quickly towards the 2760 (minor trough) subsequent support thereafter.On the upside, the immediate resistance is still pegged at the 2862 minor peak, as the next vital obstacle lies at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Traders have turned the focus onto the EU summit at the end of the week and there’s a feeling there could be more meat on the bones for how policy makers plan to stabilise the eurozone.Up until now it has all been just rhetoric and bold statements but traders need more than just talk if they are to seriously consider exposing themselves to more risk in Europe.As European banks continue to be downgraded the flip side is that Asian banks look set to gain. More Western banks are pulling out of the region while struggling to acquire the same borrowing rates as Asian banks as investors demand a high price to buy their debt.OCBC, DBS and UOB could benefit from the widespread downgrades among European banks which are likely to continue in the months ahead. Today OCBC will be keenly watched after announcing another round of share buybacks.On the commodities front, US crude oil edged up slightly with expectations of tropical storm Debby disrupting supplies in the Gulf of Mexico.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues April 24, 2012 Bad economic news from Europe and disappointing company earnings reports from the US are not likely to provide inspiration in local trading.OCBC Investment Research said:The 1% correction on Wall Street close overnight and the poor Nikkei start (-0.8% now) are likely to dent local sentiments further this morning.As a recap, the STI initiated a fairly sharp bearish reversal yesterday; following a 0.1% lower opening, the index slipped persistently for the rest of the day to close nearly 1.1% in the red. And with today's tone likely to remain downside biased, the index could see further selling pressure towards the immediate support at 2946 (recent trough).Beyond that, the subsequent vital base is still pegged at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support. On the upside, 3010 (recent peak) is now the immediate obstacle to overcome, with the next key resistance pegged at the 3030 level (various key peaks).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Some very bearish winds of global economic turmoil are expected to blow across Asia today after European manufacturing data and political unrest spooked traders.Manufacturing activity fell to a five-month low in the eurozone which came just hours after Chinese factory output showed further contraction, seriously derailing hopes of a concerted economic recovery.On European bourses, the DAX slumped 3.4%, the CAC lost 2.8% while the FTSE 100 fell 1.9%. These big falls came about not just because of the weak economic data but the fact that the messy world of politics is now complicating any eurozone recovery.With French elections and a Dutch government walkout, cracks are starting to appear in the political system as resistance grows to much-needed austerity measures.The markets also didn’t like the fact that the eurozone’s two biggest economies – France and Germany – are also struggling and won’t be dragging the rest of the community out of recession anytime soon. Those optimists who thought the eurozone would bounce back quickly from such a severe crisis which has brought with it deep budget cuts, mass unemployment and civil unrest are experiencing a major reality check. Not surprisingly the single currency slid yesterday and is down to $1.314 against the dollar.While Europe flounders, the US is not providing much support to global growth either. The US corporate earnings season is starting to lose its shine after last week’s promising start. ConocoPhillips was the latest to disappoint as earnings dropped 3% in Q1 for America’s third largest oil company.Apple’s results will be keenly watched tomorrow but already the stock is no longer defying gravity as it slipped to $571.70 a share.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were both down 0.8% while the NASDAQ shed 1%.So once again the buck stops with China, once the world’s growth engine, as a source of hope for a global recovery. Yesterday’s flash manufacturing figures disappointed traders in Asia, even though they showed a slight improvement and pointed to China factory activity bottoming out.But this wasn’t enough to convince traders in Asia, as the STI slid more than 1% yesterday. Today’s session could see further downward pressure on the local market as a key resistance level of 2950 may be tested.",0.011396597139537334,0.9698083996772766,0.018795020878314972
"STI set to open lower amidst expected volatile week for markets IG Markets Singapore forecasts the STI to open around 0.5% lower.OCBC Investment Research said:Despite the modest gains on Wall Street last Friday night, local sentiments are likely to be dampened by poor Nikkei start (down 0.4% now) and the retreating US index futures (down 0.2% now).As a recap, the STI rebounded strongly at the 2800 key psychological support to close just 0.1% lower in the previous session despite opening more than 1% in the red.And with today's tone likely to turn downside biased, we could see the index slipping back towards the 2800 immediate base again, with the subsequent support lying at the 2760 minor trough.On the upside, the immediate resistance is still pegged at the 2862 minor peak, as the next vital obstacle lies at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:With no major moves in the US equity markets on Friday, all the major benchmarks posted modest gains following on from the second largest daily fall in 2012 on Thursday. The standout performer was the Nasdaq, which managed to add 1.2%. Most of Friday’s gains have already been erased in the pre-market futures trading this morning.In the currency space there is little real change to where we stood at the Singapore close on Friday. On the whole, risk currencies and the yen remain pressured by US dollar strength following on from the FOMC meeting last week. Oil managed to stage a mini recovery on Friday with front month WTI pushing back above $80.00 at times and well off the intra-day lows, in the end settling at $79.76.

On the upside, 2980 (minor peak) is the immediate obstacle to overcome, while the next lies at the 3000 psychological resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Looking forward, China’s trade balance will be in the spotlight and investors will be looking for a trade surplus of approximately $22 billion and hoping for signs of resilience across both its imports and exports. The breakdown will be telling of China’s current growth profile.A weak export number will fuel concerns that Europe’s recession is having a marked effect, while the import number will be a key influence of sentiment toward commodities.The futures market is pointing to a weak open for the STI this morning given the uncertainty ahead for global markets.",0.12767677009105682,0.8392363786697388,0.03308693692088127

On the downside, the immediate base is pegged at the 2800 psychological support, with the subsequent support marked at the 2735 minor trough.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Despite the positive performance of the STI, yesterday’s poor Asian session was followed by a rally fuelled by QE expectations, which suggests anything other than all guns blazing from the Fed later may well disappoint markets.We have to face facts, no action or limited action such as an extension to the existing ‘operation twist’, are actually just as likely as a big play from the Fed at this point in time.The wait and see approach adopted until this point in time may well seem the best course of action, as with many of the central banks it seems to have less options available to stimulate the economy now than ever before. This lack of options and the possibility of the situation continuing to deteriorate from here for the global economy mean it may well keep what many see as its final play in the locker for now.With expectations rife, we saw solid gains for European and US equities, risk currencies flourish and even oil manage to advance, despite continuing slow progress in the talks between Iran and EU nations.All of this means we are pricing the benchmark indices to open around 0.9% higher in Singapore this morning.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs April 26, 2012 Signs point to a stronger opening for the STI following Nikkei’s positive start and the rally of US markets.OCBC Investment Research said:The rally on Wall Street overnight and positive Nikkei start (up 0.5% now) are likely to boost local sentiments this morning.As a recap, the STI continued to consolidate in a muted fashion yesterday; after a 0.3% higher opening, the index barely moved for the rest of the day. By the close, the index was just about 0.2% in the black.But with today's tone likely to show some improvements, we could see the index inching higher towards the 3010 (recent peak) immediate resistance.Beyond that, we still see the subsequent key obstacle at the 3030 vital resistance (various key peaks). On the downside, the immediate support remains at 2946 (recent trough), followed by the vital base at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The door to more Fed monetary easing may have closed a little more last night but while it still remains ajar there is hope for QE3 junkies.While talk of monetary easing was never really on the cards last night the Fed gave some cheer by upgrading growth forecasts for the US economy. Policymakers are confident that the weak patch of data we are seeing is just a blip on a gradual road to recovery. But we are unlikely to see a Bernanke Bounce as traders treat this latest statement with caution.In fact the Fed talked about a Spring drop in activity being “payback” from the warm weather-induced pick up at the start of the year. The tone was also more hawkish as an end to the low interest rate environment was discussed.But bulls can take heart from the US corporates' forecast-beating first quarter with Apple the cream of the crop. Its stock rose to US$610 last night helping to improve sentiment further.Apple probably has a higher market value than the combined worth of the eurozone’s peripheral economies.Among the better-than-expected results announced last night was Las Vegas Sands, owners of Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, which saw profits more than double in quarter one.On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7%, the S&P was 1.4% higher while the NASDAQ surged 2.3%. Apple shares put on nearly 9% and Boeing’s flew more than 5% following positive earnings.On the commodity markets, oil edged higher off the back of stronger projected US growth this year. WTI crude rose 0.5% to $103.71 a barrel while Brent rose 0.7% to $119.19.As we head towards a July 1 EU embargo it seems Iran is still keen to do deals with nations to skirt around this ban. The latest could be a tie-up with Russia to halt its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting the sanctions.But oil is still on an upward trajectory as none of the talk of ramping up supplies and easing tensions with Iran have permanently taken the risk premium out of prices.Gold did very little last night as it refused to be swayed by Fed’s higher GDP forecasts or another monthly meeting without mention of QE3. It sits unchanged at $1643 an ounce.In Singapore today we have industrial production figures out at lunchtime. February’s figures saw a 12.1% rise on a year-on-year basis but this was skewed by Chinese New Year falling in January this year.These figures are proving very hard to predict as different sectors overperform (such as biomedical) and boost overall factory output masking slumps in more traditional areas (electronics).The futures market is hinting at a stronger opening for the STI this morning after a relatively flat session yesterday.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs April 12, 2012 Amidst recovery from Western markets, the STI is hoping to recover after slumping 1.2% on Wednesday for its biggest one day loss of the year.IG Markets Singapore said:US and European equities regained some poise last night although it took suggestions of central bank asset-buying to put the brakes on the five-day slide.Markets have been sunning themselves with a worst-is-over-for-eurozone mentality only to be caught in a thunderstorm of Spanish and Italian debt fears. With Europe’s third and fourth-largest economies struggling to balance tough austerity measures while reducing government debts, traders have become very nervous about the crisis re-igniting.But all it needed was the soothing words of an European Central Bank member to suggest that more asset-buying may take place to calm the markets. Never mind the gargantuan government debts, threat of a deep recession and no growth anytime soon.The FTSE 100 gained 0.7%, the DAX was up 1% while the CAC 40 rose 0.6%. US markets were helped with commodity player Alcoa kicking off the earnings season with an unexpected profit for Q1. These results were a welcome shot in the arm for the recently bleak outlook on the world’s largest economy.Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% last night. But the Beige Book did little to change sentiment reiterating the US economy was growing at “a modest to moderate pace.”So for a quantitative easing (QE) recap: ECB – back on the cards, Fed – temporarily off the cards, PBOC – always on the cards, BOJ – always on the cards.In Singapore, the STI slumped 1.2% yesterday – its biggest one day loss of the year – and will be hoping to steady the ship after last night’s slight recovery from Western markets.

"STI set for firmer open amidst news of EU bailout Markets are likely to rebound following news that Chinese inflation eased and Spanish banks were bailed out by the EU, says IG Markets Singapore.IG Markets Singapore noted:Markets are likely to see a healthy bounce today after weekend news that Spanish banks were bailed out by the EU and Chinese inflation eased.While no-one is denying the strong headwinds still blowing into Asia from many directions, regional investors may be lifted by immediate concerns having eased as they start the week.At the end of last week fears of a Spanish banking meltdown continued to spook the markets while China’s surprise interest rate cut led some to believe it was softening up the markets for some very bad economic data.In the end the EU came to Spain’s rescue with a €100 billion rescue package while China’s data was weak, but not as weak as many had feared.While markets may get a short-term lift, the Spanish bank bailout points to a worrying trend. This is the biggest economy to receive an EU/IMF hand-out so far. The casualties of the eurozone crisis seem to be getting bigger after Greece, Ireland and Portugal previously received rescue funds.This latest bailout may stoke more fears than it calms, once the champagne runs out. Another side effect is the bad taste in Greek mouths that they got a poor deal on their own bailout agreement by having to sign up to more arduous terms that the Spanish. This may increase the anti-bailout sentiment ahead of crucial elections at the weekend.With these elections now only days away, we may be witnessing the calm before the storm.When it comes to China, there may be no storm, just a heavy downpour with its latest economic data. There is definitely a slowdown looking at industrial production, retail sales and investment, but not a big enough one to cause panic within the world’s second biggest economy.Domestic demand is still strong while another month of falling inflation gives the PBOC more room for manoeuvre to cut interest rates and relax the reserve requirements for its banks.China is still well placed to steer its jumbo jet of an economy down onto the runway via a soft landing, if that is what GDP growth of about 8% can be described as. Eurozone economies would call this level of growth a miracle.After last week’s surprise cut in interest rates the Chinese government was sending out a message that it is dedicated to stimulating economic growth and will take action when it feels appropriate. The cut itself is expected to do very little.Behind the scenes it has been ramping up infrastructure spending around the country and has the tools at its disposal to boost consumption from within to shield itself from the euro pain. This week is also a big one for the US economy. Last week Wall Street enjoyed its best week of the year despite Ben Bernanke failing to progress hopes of quantitative easing. So this week he will have the chance to justify his confidence in the US economic recovery with retail sales, Empire State manufacturing and inflation figures out in the coming days.On the currency markets, the euro has risen on the Spanish banking bailout moving above the $1.26 mark to trade this morning at $1.263. Commodity markets also saw a huge boost from Chinese and Spanish developments. Oil rose its most in five months having been battered recently by eurozone woes, increased supply, rising stockpiles and threats of weaker global demand.Brent crude rallied 2.7% to move above the $100 threshold, to trade at $102.09 a barrel. US Crude shot up 2.5% to trade at $86.25.Gold has held steady sitting at $1603 an ounce.The futures market points to a much firmer open for the STI this morning.

Meanwhile, the secondary support is located at the 2852-2860 gap support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Big drops in profits among some of Singapore’s most loved stocks will be a concern to traders worried about the resilience of the local economy to weather the global storm.To add to a growing list of under-achievers releasing poor Q1 earnings are Noble, City Development and Genting. They join the likes of Singapore Airlines and Wilmar which yesterday also disappointed investors.Commodity giant Noble has seen profits fall 46%, joining rival Wilmar which saw its Q1 profits slump this week. Property developer City Developments posted a 45% drop in profits, although this was skewed by a one-time gain for Q1 2011.More bad news came from gambling firm Genting, a long-time investor favourite, which saw profits plummet 33% due to lower gambling revenues.These poor results are likely to weigh heavily on traders’ minds this morning who are still digesting an eventful week of panic-stricken trading as the future of the eurozone hangs in the balance.Thankfully, last night Wall Street got down to business and put on some mild gains as we enter the final day of trading this week.",0.013623443432152271,0.97068190574646,0.015694625675678253

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed May 16, 2012 Weaker opening awaits the STI following the retreat on Wall Street and the poor Nikkei start.OCBC Investment Research said:The continued retreat on Wall Street overnight, coupled with the poor Nikkei start (-0.4% now) are likely to spook the local bourse to a lower opening as well this morning.Despite staging a recovery with a 0.4% higher close yesterday, that is likely to be just a technical rebound. With market outlook still looking rather pessimistic now, we expect investors to take this opportunity to sell into strength today.For now, 2900 (key support-turned-resistance) remains a very tough obstacle to overcome in the near term; this ahead of the subsequent resistance at the 2950 support-turned-resistance.On the downside, 2850 (yesterday's intraday low) is likely to offer a mild support while we could see a firmer support at the next key base of 2800 (key resistance-turned-support).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The futures markets points to a weaker open for the STI this morning. Commodity giant Olam could be under pressure today as its Q3 profits dipped 22.5%.

"Singapore dollar trades at $1.2834 The local currency has gained slightly on the greenback as a G7 conference call took the edge of the eurozone crisis, according to IG Markets Singapore.IG Markets Singapore said:The Singapore dollar has gained slightly on the greenback as a G7 conference call took the edge of the eurozone crisis yesterday.The local currency trades at $1.2834 this morning having flirted with the $1.29 ceiling at the start of the week. Traders were lifted by hopes that world leaders would be ready to intervene if the crisis deepened.This could still happen if the Spanish banking sector is left to collapse sending markets into a tailspin.But for the time being a sense of calm seems to have temporarily returned to currency markets, which has boosted the Singapore dollar along with other Asian currencies.This is another important week for central banks which can influence the USD/SGD pair. The Fed’s Ben Bernanke testifies to Congress on the health of the US economy tonight, while later today the ECB meets to discuss interest rates.RBS, on the other hand, reported:After slipping overnight after downward revisions to French and German services and composite PMIs, EUR/USD held in a tight range ahead of the ECB meeting.Our EU Economics team expects the ECB to leave the benchmark rate unchanged but to revise down its forecasts for growth and to extend fixed rate full allotment lending. Considering the sharp declines in the EU 5-year swap rate, we believe the market may be expecting a rate cut to come at the ECB meeting.An unchanged policy rate could disappoint some participants and given the record net short EUR positioning per IMM data, the EUR could get a bounce in such a scenario.But even if the EUR bounces initially on an unchanged rate, we think there could be hints or signals of future easing in the statement and the press conference, which, along with possibly lower growth and inflation staff forecasts, will likely keep the EUR weak. Thus we would look to fade any rallies in the EUR.GFT meanwhile noted:One of the most important event risks this week is Wednesday’s European Central Bank monetary policy announcement. The near-term outlook for the EUR/USD hinges on the ECB’s degree of proactiveness.Throughout Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, the ECB has only been reactive but after avoiding the issue for weeks and constantly passing the ball back to politicians, ECB President Draghi will have no choice but to address the deterioration in economic data, the strain on Spanish finances and the decline in asset markets around the world.Based upon recent developments in the financial markets and the economy, the ECB should ease quickly and aggressively. However the decision will not be an easy one because Mario Draghi is extremely close in succeeding on his attempts to pressure European politicians into action.If he waits a few more weeks, we will probably get an announcement from G20 leaders. As a result, the ECB meeting will be a very close call because the ECB needs to ease but there are advantages to waiting.In addition to the monetary policy announcement and ECB President Draghi’s press conference, the central bank will also release its latest quarterly inflation and GDP forecasts – both of which are expected to be lowered.",0.5598810911178589,0.385551780462265,0.05456707254052162
"STI set for negative opening following 0.4% lower close Downside momentum is expected with the index showing difficulties overcoming the 2800 level.OCBC Investment Research said:With most US stocks retreating overnight and the Nikkei having a poor start (down 0.7% now), these are likely to cue the local bourse to a negative opening this morning. With the STI clearly showing some difficulties overcoming the 2800 psychological level with a 0.4% lower close yesterday, we could potentially see it maintaining its downside momentum today.For now, we still see the immediate support at around 2735 (minor trough), with the subsequent base lying at the 2700 level (major trough in Jun '12).Beyond the 2800 psychological resistance, we continue to peg the next obstacle at the 2830 minor peak.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The ‘calm before the storm’ is perhaps how one might describe recent market moves. Alternatively we could be in the eye of the hurricane. Either way it could be easy for one to be lulled in to a false sense of security. Last night US markets were nervously flat for most of the session, with seemingly a slight positive bias on the day as a whole. Then in the afternoon a sell-off in equities means we finish firmly in the red. With the major US indices closing between 0.6% and 0.9% lower, the leads for the regional markets today are poor. With a mixed performance around Asian bourses yesterday we are likely to see a similar situation in play today. The dark debt cloud of uncertainty remains over the eurozone. The step forward made through the recapitalisation of the Spanish banks has lacked detail and any new solace investors sought from it was short lived. Globally, investors now understand the issues in play for this crisis and that the devil is certainly in the detail of any new plan to move forward.Furthermore, the ominous sight of the second Greek election looms large on the horizon with the possibility of a further stalemate as likely as any other result. This is potentially the worst possible outcome for global markets as further uncertainty will damage what is left of investor confidence.

For now, 3030 remains the vital obstacle to overcome, with the subsequent resistance marked at the 3060 support-turned-resistance.On the downside, 2945 (recent minor trough) is still the immediate support, followed by the subsequent key base at the 2900 vital resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In this climate bad news trumps good news, especially when it is weaker data coming out of the world’s biggest economy. And that’s exactly what traders experienced last night as US unemployment claims, home sales and the Philly Fed manufacturing data all missed expectations.This overshadowed the initial euphoria from Europe when Spain successfully sold €2.5 billion worth of bonds. However, it had to pay a high price in the 10-year period compared to January’s auction. Yields edged up from 5.4% to 5.74% while demand was strong.But the champagne was put on ice after rumours that France was going to be downgraded circulated trading floors.

The S&P was 0.6% lower at 1377, while the NASDAQ shed 0.8% to finish at 3008. Not even growing optimism over US corporate earnings could turn the tide of negative sentiment last night.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were the latest US behemoths to report earnings last night which were both boosted by higher trading revenue. Risk assets did not experience the relief rally that was expected following the relatively successful eurozone bond auctions. Commodities were relatively flat after losing the momentum they picked up from whispers about China monetary easing.Oil prices also slipped on the back of the poor US economic data reversing the gains made after an IMF report on global growth and Spain’s smooth debt sale boosted trader confidence.WTI crude sits at $102.27 a barrel while Brent crude trades at $117.44.In Singapore, the STI starts the day sitting in unfamiliar territory above 3000 points after making small gains yesterday.

"STI shows more signs of optimism The index closed 1.3% higher in the last session, with analysts expecting further improvement in sentiment.OCBC Investment Research said:The continued recovery on Wall Street last Friday night and the sharply higher Nikkei 225 index (up 2.1% now) are likely to cue the local bourse to a stronger opening this morning. The STI had already started to show more signs of optimism with a 1.3% higher close in the last session; the 2800 psychological resistance was conquered at the same time.And with today's sentiment likely to improve further, we could see the index recovering further towards the 2830 minor peak for a test today.Beyond that, the next resistance lies at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance. On the downside, the immediate support is now pegged at the 2800 level, with the subsequent base marked at the 2735 minor trough.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:For the second consecutive Monday risk assets have received an early boost, as the results of the Greek Election seem to suggest a majority coalition government can be formed. The pro-euro party New Democracy polled in first place, as the conservatives managed to beat the extreme left Syriza in the ballot. Although the difference in support was only a couple of percentage points with the winner taking an extra 50 seats New Democracy are easily the largest party in the new parliament. If, as hoped, an agreement with Pasok can be reached then the new coalition will control in the region of 161 of the 300 seats, according to the latest projections, which will be a workable majority. Questions even at this early stage seem to be arising on how strong this coalition will truly be.Sadly despite this morning’s rally in the markets, many questions still remain as to the next move for the new government: Greece is in its sixth year of recession, has unemployment above 20 pc and confidence is so low in its banks savers are burying their cash in the mountains.The bailout terms are also likely to remain in the spotlight as pressure remains for these to be eased by the Toika, especially after the latest Spanish bailout deal. The fact of the matter is even New Democracy is not really pro the bailout in its current state. As we headed in to the polls it was clear they were trying to win voters by emphasising this fact, much as Syriza was trying hard to point out that a vote for them did not necessarily mean automatically exiting the euro.The G20 summit now beginning in Mexico will be breathing a collective sigh of relief as this latest twist in the Greek tragedy plays out without much drama so far. They are likely to realise that we are at an early stage and the new government is not formed, but they can perhaps focus on Spanish and Italian bond yields as their next main focus in trying to sort out the mess of debt in Europe.We now enter a period to the end of the month full of risk events as far as the market is concerned. The main solution to the problems suffered in many nations so far has been to throw additional capital at them and apply austerity measures. As this appears not to be the answer that is keeping markets, politicians or the public happy much of what happens over the next couple of weeks will allow us to see if an alternative solution can be found.With this in mind how the Fed react to the latest developments out of Europe will still be one of the key events, with still mixed views in the market as to we will see further QE or not. Wednesday’s FOMC testimony is awaited eagerly for this very reason. This is followed by a ‘non-policy’ meeting from the ECB on Thursday. With the belief by some that there might be some co-ordinated action from the central banks, to help ease market pressures further especially for some of the European bond yields, if the Fed twists rather than sticks we may well see this ECB meeting being more than ‘non-policy’ as they take some form of action themselves.All of this will be followed by an EU leader’s summit on the 28th and 29th June where the deeper integration of the euro will be discussed and early blueprints for this could be released. Given many feel this is what has been lacking in this crisis if we can get some movement towards this we could well see another positive reaction in the risk assets, especially euro related.Looking forward to the rest of the day the real question is will the relief rally in risk assets last, after last week’s short lived Monday rally investors are likely to remain wary. So far this morning we have seen Asian equities around 1.5% higher, as they catch up with Friday’s American rally and receive a further leg up on the weekend’s positive news.Euro, aussie and sterling have all made strong gains in early trade but are now already off from early highs. Oil is around 1% higher in early trade and gold is flat.As investors globally digest the weekend’s events and get ready for another potentially choppy week the main question will be how much of this gain remains at the end of the day. Currently we see the STI following the early Asian leads with the open coming in around 1.5% higher.",0.6409664154052734,0.2727920413017273,0.08624152839183807
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon April 9, 2012 Signs point to a weaker STI opening amidst bad news on US employment and the soft Nikkei start.OCBC Investment Research said:Although Wall Street ended muted last Thursday night, the sharply lower US index futures (-1% now) and the poor Nikkei start (-1.5% now) are likely to dent local sentiments this morning.As recap, the STI had turned in a muted session in the last session with a flat close; at the same time, forming a relatively strong base at around the 2975 support (recent trough).But with today's tone likely to deteriorate quickly, we could see the index breaking this 2975 immediate base before slipping further in the direction of the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.On the upside, 3030 remains the vital resistance to overcome in the near term, with the next obstacle pegged at the 3075 support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Stock market confidence has been dealt a series of blows which could lead to caution and consolidation among traders this week. The latest of these body punches to market optimism was dealt on Friday with US government employment figures coming in well below market expectations.Traders were hoping non-farm payrolls data would help end the week on a high but they came in at just 120,000 for March, woefully short of the consensus 205,000.Last week the Fed hinted that QE3 was slipping down the agenda, in an attempt to wean the markets off the cheap liquidity they have becoming addicted to. Traders went into shock and the markets tumbled. It came in the same week that eurozone concerns resurfaced with Spain struggling to sell its government debt without having to increase yields. Expect plenty of “pain in Spain as debt fears remain” stories.Global markets suffered and the pressure mounted on non-farm payrolls data to continue the positive trend of adding more than 200,000 jobs each month this year. Traders were already worried unemployment wasn’t coming down fast enough and the US’s economic recovery was built on shifting sand. All eyes will now be on US corporate earnings for Q1 which will start trickling out this month. But the early signs on these don’t look good.Thankfully, the US market were closed on Good Friday along with most major bourses preventing traders from pushing the panic button. But when they reopen this week the reaction may still be the same. Asian traders are likely to remain cautious, waiting for US and European markets to reopen to gauge how much damage the latest US employment bombshell has done. But the mood is already gloomier with the Nikkei 225 opening much softer this morning.The futures market is pointing to a weaker open for the STI this morning.",0.0271599180996418,0.9530730843544006,0.019766954705119133
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon May 7, 2012 Things are looking bad in local trading following significant retreat on Wall Street and Nikkei’s negative start.OCBC Investment Research said:The sharp pullback on Wall Street last Friday night and the very poor Nikkei start (-2.6% now) are likely spook the local bourse to a pessimistic opening as well this morning.As such, the STI which already shown signs of a reversing south on Friday with a 0.3% loss, could retreat further this morning in the direction of the 2946 (recent trough) support. Should this support be breached in the days ahead, the next vital base at 2900 (key resistance-turned-support) could then be tested.On the upside, 3010 (minor peaks) remains the immediate obstacle to overcome, as the subsequent key resistance still lies at 3030 (various key peaks).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:It is looking like deja vu for the US economy as another strong start to the year makes way for doom and gloom and talk of another false dawn.And if Friday’s poor payrolls reaction on Wall Street is anything to go by, it looks like traders have banged in the final nail in the coffin for the green shoots of recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.3% at 13038, the benchmark S&P 500 was 1.6% lower at 1369 while the NASDAQ plummeted 2.3%.There was a dim ray of sunshine as February and March’s payrolls data were revised upwards but the bears took hold of April’s weak employment growth as a sign that the US economy would slipping back this year.If this wasn’t reason enough to sit on the sidelines European elections are doing just as much damage to bullish sentiment as Friday’s weak employment figures. Sarkozy being toppled in France hasn’t been taken well although the Greek election results have exploded like a ticking time bomb. A disgruntled Greek electorate has been waiting to vent their spleens at the latest round of austerity measures and yesterday they had their chance by ousting the ruling parties.Once the dust settles the big questions will be what the incumbent political parties plan to do regarding the proposed budget cuts, their future role in the eurozone and whether to pull out of the euro.So all in all, Asia has some very dark rain clouds swiftly moving across the region today and likely to remain for the week ahead. While the STI had a topsy-turvy week last week moving in and out of the 3000 level, this week is likely to keep traders on their toes looking for any positive clues. “Sell in May and go away” will be ringing in many traders’ ears this morning as they wake up to very grey, if not black, Monday.",0.013567525893449783,0.9634465575218201,0.02298581786453724

The sulk led to falls on Wall Street with the S&P 500 slipping 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5%.Fed minutes revealed that only two out the 10 members felt quantitative easing “could become necessary” if the economic outlook weakens.The disappointment led to a sharp rise in the dollar, and widespread sell-offs in gold and commodities. European stocks also suffered a pullback.Gold futures dropped to $1648 an ounce just as the precious metal was struggling to recover from last month’s dip, again after a Fed announcement that dashed hopes of QE3. Traders should see this further softening as another buying opportunity as the bullish sentiment remains.A total of 84% of IG Markets’ clients have taken long positions on gold. Many traders still have $2000-plus an ounce within their sights for year-end.Oil has also come off a little as speculation of a strategic release of emergency oil reserves gathers pace. But the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been sending out mixed messages about how tight supply is right now, and how it will be affected when Iran is cut off.While some IEA members are downplaying the Iranian crisis, others now seem to be actively preparing to release emergency stocks to ease supposedly tight supplies. There is also the big question of whether the IEA can legally use countries’ stockpiles if there’s no serious disruption to world supplies.WTI crude has slipped 1.2% to $104.01 a barrel while Brent sits 0.5% down at $124.98.Asian markets are likely to have a weaker start following the Fed minutes and Wall Street’s reaction. It may take some time for traders to acknowledge that fading QE3 means US policymakers feel confident the economy will recover and needs no further stimulus, which is a positive sign of a global economic recovery taking shape and less need for artificial liquidity.But watching the US economy recover is like watching a tortoise cross the street. Painfully slow and with plenty of hazards with each passing car, or in this case with each new release of economic data.Friday’s non-farms payroll data will show just how fast, or slow, employment is picking up which has so far been the main cause of the optimism.In Singapore today DBS could warrant more attention after seeing its share price slip 2.7% yesterday after investors reacted badly to plans to buy Danamon. Many feel DBS may have overpaid for the Indonesian bank.It now faces pressure from Indonesian lawmakers unhappy about a foreign bank taking over one of its biggest local lenders. But there could be some support for the local market with data showing Singapore’s manufacturing sector expanded for the second consecutive month.

"STI up 1.1% Investors may opt to take profit on the recent gains should the index be unable to sustain itself above 2900, says OCBC Investment Research.OCBC Investment Research said:U.S. stocks on Friday jumped up following an agreement between European Union leaders to take steps to boost the economies of its more troubled economies.WTI Crude for Aug gained US$7.27, or 9.4%, to end at US$84.96/barrel, rebounding from its lowest closing price since 4 Oct 2011. Brent for Aug delivery also gained US$6.44, or 7.0%, to finish at US$97.80/barrel.Gold for Aug delivery rose US$53.80, or 3.5%, to end at U$1,604.20/ounce. Silver for Jul delivery gained US$1.32, or 5.0%, to end at US$27.61/ounce.While the strong showing on Wall Street Friday is likely to keep local sentiment buoyant this morning, the lackluster Nikkei showing (now only up 0.3% after opening 1.1% higher) could cap the STI’s gains.As a recap, the index was already up 1.1% last Friday; and with the STI already nearing the key 2900 psychological resistance, investors may opt to take profit on the recent gains should the index be unable to sustain itself above 2900.Beyond 2900, the next hurdle is likely at 2950. On the downside, the initial support is likely found at 2850, ahead of 2800.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Only time will tell how long this EU summit-inspired rally will last. Friday’s shot in the arm for global markets was combined with end-of-quarter window dressing to put a smile back on the faces of traders.The STI gained a healthy 1.1% on Friday and Asia is likely to see more positive repercussions after Wall Street and Europe gained convincingly on the outcome of the 19th summit.However there is the fear that risk assets may continue rising in the short-term on this current euphoric wave only for profit-taking and reality to kick in sooner rather than later. But it is so easy to be cynical at these times and say we’ve seen it all before. We haven’t. For the first time there is a clear intention to use the eurozone's bailout funds to buy sovereign bonds in the secondary market. While this was already built into the EFSF and ESM it still needed the political button to be pressed. It finally has.Another very positive step is news that funds for Spain's banking sector bail-out will come directly from the EFSF and not the ESM, while the funds won’t be senior to government bonds issued. This will ease concerns among private sector bondholders as to where they stand in the queue when it comes to payouts.There is also the long-term plan of setting up a supervisory mechanism for banks. Once this is established it will allow the ESM to recapitalize banks directly.This was perhaps the most positive on the steps announced although it may take at least a year to set up.",0.8974617123603821,0.0713535025715828,0.031184734776616096
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri April 27, 2012 Firmer opening is expected for the STI, although gains are likely to be limited.OCBC Investment research said:The further recovery on Wall Street overnight and positive Nikkei start (up 0.2% now) are likely to cue the local bourse to a higher opening this morning.However, any gains are likely to be limited as the STI has not shown any signs of breaking out from its tight trading range yet; the index was pretty lacklustre yesterday, closing nearly flat.For now, 3010 (recent peak) is still the immediate resistance to overcome as the subsequent key obstacle lies at 3030 (various key peaks).On the downside, the immediate support remains at 2946 (recent trough), followed by the vital base at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Wall Street and Europe put on solid gains last night as better-than-expected housing data, strong corporate earnings and clinging hopes of Fed monetary easing buoyed the markets.The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ both gained 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9%.US corporate earnings have on the whole come in above expectations for quarter one with Starbucks and Amazon the latest names to delight investors. Yet jobless claims have risen sparking fears of a slowdown in the labour market while consumer confidence took a dive. This continues the mixed signals the US economy is throwing up as investors seek guidance on how resilient its economic recovery is.European markets also performed well last night but were capped by news that Spain is to be downgraded to BBB by ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.However, few were genuinely surprised given the state of Spain’s budget deficit, economy and unemployment. What is more worrying is the health of European banks which have been taking ECB cheap borrowing hand-outs during this eurozone crisis but don’t seem to be in any better shape.Markets have been pretty volatile this week and last night’s mixed messages hold few clues to how Asia will end the week.",0.5096785426139832,0.4419787526130676,0.048342738300561905
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed April 18, 2012 Nikkei started strong following positive news from both Europe and the United States.IG Markets Singapore said:Strong gains on Wall Street and Europe last night bode well for a firm opening across Asian markets this morning, although there was still an underlying note of caution.An easing of tensions in Europe while disappointing US housing starts and factory output data sent out mixed messages last night but the bulls won the day.The S&P 500 rose 1.6% to 1391, within touching distance of the 1400 threshold it breached last quarter while the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up 1.5%. The best-performing index was the NASDAQ which surged 1.8%.The number of US companies showing strong earnings growth continues to swell with Goldman Sachs and Coca-Cola added to their names to the list.In Europe, the FTSE 100 went up 1.8% while the DAX shot up 2.7%. The yields on Spanish 10-year bonds have edged away from the dangerous 6% mark although Thursday offers a stronger test of faith with another decisive debt auction.Sentiment in Europe was also helped by a strong German ZEW index and the pledge of Japan to offer $50 billion to boost IMF firepower for the euro crisis. Japan relies heavily on Europe to buy its exports so this is a good example of economic altruism.In Singapore today, the Q1 earnings season kicks off with Cambridge Industrial Trust, CapitaMall Trust and Keppel Land. Commodity players could spring a few surprises while property players are likely to hold steady in the face of cooling measures.As always, the banking sector will be closely watched to gauge the underlying strength of the economy. With last weeks’ uplifting 9.9% Q1 GDP growth followed by downbeat export numbers yesterday, traders could do with more guidance from the financial sector as to the economy’s true health.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:The rally on Wall Street overnight and the strong Nikkei start (+1.6% now) are likely to boost local sentiments this morning.As a recap, the STI continued to consolidate in a muted fashion yesterday; after opening about 0.2% higher, the index moderated to a 0.2% loss by the close as trading volume dwindled further.But with today's tone likely to improve significantly, we could see the index overcoming the 3005 (recent minor peak) immediate resistance with relative ease before attempting another break at the 3030 vital obstacle again.On the downside, 2945 (recent minor trough) is still the immediate support, followed by the subsequent key base at the 2900 vital resistance-turned-support.",0.9405174851417542,0.03612270578742027,0.023359796032309532
"STI set for weaker open amidst market skepticism OCBC Investment Research says sentiment is likely to turn more downside biased.Here’s more from OCBC Investment Research:The mixed reactions on Wall Street overnight and the negative Nikkei start (down 0.5% now) are likely to direct the local bourse to a weaker opening this morning. Despite opening some 1.4% yesterday morning, the STI lost much of its earlier gains to close just 0.5% in the black; this suggesting that investors are generally still feeling skeptical about the recent market optimism.And with today's sentiment likely to turn more downside biased, we could potentially see the index heading lower towards the 2800 psychological support for a test.Below that, the next base is marked at the 2735 minor trough. On the upside, 2850 (yesterday's intraday high) is now the immediate obstacle to overcome, with the subsequent hurdle pegged at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The risk rally bubble burst in Europe for the second successive Monday, despite all the positives that could be sought from the right election result for investors out of Greece, in what was a close battle. The next European problem child started kicking and screaming, attracting almost unwanted attention, as Spain saw 10-year bond yields move back above 7% and set a euro-era record high for its debt.These latest moves once again underline the complexity of the issues facing politicians and central bankers. There is no respite between one problem seemingly being dealt with and the next emerging. Sadly, the brutal truth is despite Spain taking its turn in the unwanted limelight of this debt saga, Greek issues are in no way fully dealt with yet. By the time Singapore markets closed yesterday, we had already seen European markets give up all early gains and US futures slip in to negative territory. Looking for a guide to our open is tricky, as US benchmarks finished mixed, with DJIA closing 0.2% lower and the broader S&P500 marginally up on the day by 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite was the stand-out performer advancing 0.8%, as tech stocks outperformed the wider market. Given this mixed leads, it is unsurprising we are looking at a relatively flat open in Singapore today.",0.03881160542368889,0.9229934811592102,0.038194913417100906
"STI up 1.2%; total gains almost 5.1% since 27 June Renewed strength on Wall Street and the firmer Nikkei showing could continue to keep the local sentiment buoyant, says OCBC Investment Research.OCBC Investment Research said:Renewed strength on Wall Street and the firmer Nikkei showing (now +0.6%) could continue to keep the local sentiment buoyant; but further strong gains look unlikely as US markets are shut for holiday tonight.As a recap, the STI jumped another 1.2% yesterday, bringing the total gains to nearly 5.1% since 27 Jun; index added 9.2% since 4 Jun. Although the daily MACD remains positive, we note that the stochastic indicator is not only showing the market as heavily overbought but also converging for a possible negative crossover.As such, after filling the 2950-2987 gap, we may see profit-taking emerging if the index fails to make further headway against the key 3000 hurdle.On the downside, the immediate support remains at 2905, then the next support around 2850.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In Singapore, the economy continues to reveal signs of its resilience with manufacturing PMI data showing expansion for June, coming in at the same level as May. This is in stark contrast to the world’s biggest economies which are all suffering sharp contraction as the eurozone crisis hammers factory activity.Meanwhile employment in Singapore has fallen for a 12th straight month.But a kick in the teeth for the local economy has been delivered by Manchester United’s owners, the Glazer family, who have picked New York for its stock market listing.Singapore was in the line-up for a $1 billion IPO this year but this was put on hold due to volatile markets. The Red Devils have now announced they will list on the NYSE in a $100 million float.The share sale is on a much smaller scale than its planned Singapore listing which may be down to the Glazer’s wariness at how well received a soccer club IPO will be on a nation that prefers to throw or bounce its balls.On the plus side, at least Manchester United didn’t pick Hong Kong over Singapore.The futures market hints at a firm opening for the STI this morning, picking up the scent of an upbeat US session.

"STI forecast to head south; reactions on Wall Street muted Plus analyst says the Greek exit threat still has the potential to scare sensitive markets.OCBC Investment Research said:The muted reactions on Wall Street overnight and the negative Nikkei start (-1% now) could cue the local bourse to a poorer opening this morning.As such, the STI which jumped more than 1.2% yesterday could potentially halt its recovery and head back south today.For now, the immediate support can be found at 2795-2812 gap support, with the next support at 2763 (recent trough).On the upside, the immediate obstacle is pegged at the 2850 minor support-turned-resistance, with the subsequent resistance lying at 2900 (key support-turned-resistance).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:What looked like a dead cat bounce for the STI could be turning into something a little more substantial after another day of gains yesterday.After such a swift and sharp selloff of risk assets across the globe, the STI was due some kind of recovery as bargain hunters dipped their toes into the local market.Traders saw this on Monday but may have been surprised to see the market rise again yesterday, lifting a healthy 1.2%.A eurozone meeting of ministers today has the potential to improve the mood further with expected rhetoric on how they will save the region from collapse and persuade Greece to remain a member. But pressure grows on European leaders to provide the details for their ambitious growth and recovery plans.The Greek exit threat still has the potential to spook sensitive markets with any negative comments from government officials. This time it was former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos who yesterday warned of a Greek eurozone exit.These comments saw markets erase earlier gains which had been logged on the back of some positive US housing numbers. Fitch also rocked the boat further, announcing a downgrade of Japan's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings to 'A+' from 'AA' and 'AA-', respectively. Japanese equities will face more pressure this morning after figures show its trade gap widened by more than expected.This highlights how Asia is being sucked into the eurozone crisis in a very real way as it relies so heavily on Europe as a major trading partner.",0.18473933637142181,0.7743822336196899,0.04087839275598526

"SPI poised for flat open IG Markets Singapore says the strong performance across Wall Street and Europe may not automatically lead to another upbeat session in Asia amidst so much uncertainty.Here’s more from IG Markets Singapore:Global markets have managed to pull together a two-day winning streak after another positive session yesterday but an underlying mood of fear still remains.But the strong performance across Wall Street and Europe may not automatically lead to another upbeat session in Asia today with so much uncertainty in the air.After such a firm start to the week, traders will be pinching themselves to check if they are dreaming, as nothing has changed in the eurozone sadly.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lifted 1%, the S&P 500 rose 1.1% while NASDAQ gained 1. 2%. US data last night was a mixed bag. House prices rose the second month in a row while consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level for four months. Anyone having bought shares in Facebook’s IPO look away now – the stock is down 24% trading below $29. In Europe, the FTSE 100 ended the day 0.65% higher, the DAX was up 1.2% while in France the CAC 40 edged up 1.4% last night to cap a solid night of gains.But problems continue to stack up for the eurozone with the ill health of Spanish banks and the broader condition of the European banking sector developing into a major concern.For investors when it comes to the eurozone, no news is good news. And there were no significant announcements yesterday which lifted equities, even though Spain’s handling of its banking crisis looks ominous.For the bearish among us, this ebullient mood could just be the calm before the storm. Greek elections are looming next month while tomorrow we have an Irish referendum on the EU.The Vix index – otherwise known as the fear gauge – is trading up at 21.6 currently, compared to an average of around 18. This is a pretty good indicator of the quiet panic waiting to unleash itself when the time is right.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed April 11, 2012 The STI is up for a weaker open amidst strong negative sentiment in the US, Europe, and China.IG Markets Singapore said:Wall Street suffered its fifth straight day of losses last night as the eurozone debt crisis returned with a vengeance. Add in worries about China’s imports, lack of monetary easing in Japan and cautious comments from Ben Bernanke and it spells for a tough day of trading across Asia.If traders’ keyboards have a big green button saying ""risk on"" and a big red one with ""risk off"" their fingers will be pushing down hard on the red one today. Among US stock markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% at 12716 while the S&P also dropped 1.7% to finish lower at 1359. This was the S&P’s biggest fall since December 8 and the Dow’s largest drop since November 23. Much of Europe reopened yesterday after the Easter break and probably wished they hadn’t. The FTSE 100 plummeted 2.2% while the DAX dropped 2.5%.A sharp rise in Spanish and other peripheral European sovereign debt yields dented investor confidence. Spain’s 10-year yields are trading just below 6%, which isn’t far off the 6.7% peak they hit last November as panic was rife over a eurozone collapse.The inability of Spain's fiscal austerity measures to alleviate the pressure in the bond market is worrisome, as Economy Minister Luis de Guindos declined to rule out a rescue for the country, and Bank of Spain Governor Mr Ordonez said Spanish lenders may require additional capital if the economy weakens more than expected.While the focus is very much on Spanish and Italian debt worries, Asia did its bit to darken the mood in the world economy. China revealed in its trade balance that imports slowed sharper than expected with the Bank of Japan held off further monetary easing.Central bankers also have two big red and green buttons, and the markets don’t like the fact that so many fingers are pushing down on the big red one marked “No QE”.On the commodity markets, copper dropped to a three-month low, while US oil fell 1.4%. WTI crude is trading at $101.02 while Brent has slipped to $119.98, down 2%.Energy markets were hit hard by China’s slowing imports, as it is the world’s second biggest crude oil consumer. Further pressure was put on energy and commodity markets by comments from the IMF that prices are likely to decline this year and next on the back of weaker world growth.Gold stocks might outperform after the precious metal bucked the commodity trend and rose 1% due to safe-haven flows. It sits at $1657 an ounce.The futures markets is pointing to a much weaker open for the STI with strong negative sentiment hanging over the core economies of the US, Europe and China. DBS meanwhile noted:Having no data on the calendar always gives markets the opportunity to Blue Sky in any which direction.It’s risk-off-with-a-vengeance this week, following a lousy nonfarm payrolls report last Friday (120k in March, about half recent averages), a further rise in European tension (Spanish 10Y yields are up another 25bps since Monday and now sit at 5.98%, some 425bps over German yields) and a first quarter equity performance that, being among the strongest in decades, appears to have investors wondering if they should take some of their gains and go home.US and global equities are down 4%-5% over the past 4-5 sessions and 10Y US Treasury yields, which had soared to 2.38% just three weeks ago, have, mostly since Friday, slammed back to 1.98%, about the midpoint of where they traded between December and February.OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, reported:With US stocks tumbling more than 1.5% overnight and the Nikkei having a poor start (-1.2% now), these are likely to spook the local bourse to a negative opening as well this morning.As a recap, the STI initiated a technical rebound yesterday after the relatively sharp fall on Monday; following a 0.1% gain the open, the index climbed steadily for the rest of the day to end almost 0.8% higher.But with today's tone likely to deteriorate significantly, we could see the index turning back south to test the 2955 support (recent low). A break below this base could see the index heading straight for the 2900 key resistance-turned-support in the weeks ahead.On the upside, 3030 (key peaks) remains the vital key obstacle to overcome, with the subsequent resistance marked at the 3070 support-turned-resistance.",0.012648035772144794,0.9654648303985596,0.02188715897500515
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues May 8, 2012 Mild rebound is expected for the STI following a 2.2% loss on 7 May 2012.OCBC Investment Research said:The muted reactions on Wall Street overnight and the positive Nikkei start (+0.6% now) are likely to provide a temporary relief for the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI dived sharply yesterday after taking cue from the pessimistic US and European market outlook; after opening nearly 1.5% lower, the index slipped further to a 2.2% loss by the close.Following yesterday's sharp retreat, the index could potentially initiate a technical rebound today and possibly retest the newly established immediate support-turned-resistance at around 2950, with the subsequent resistance pegged at 3010 (various peaks).Should this retest fail, the index could continue to descend towards the immediate base at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support; the subsequent base lies at 2852-2860 gap support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:There’s nothing like a crisis to start your week and Asia found itself on the fringes of one yesterday as panic spread from the eurozone.Asia saw a brutal sell-off among equity traders yesterday as fears over what a new political landscape will do to the eurozone. While things may be clearer in France, Greece is unlikely to see the fog disappear for some time.But while Asia burned, Europe and Wall Street took it all in their stride as traders reacted far more calmly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2% at 13009. The S&P was flat at 1370 while the NASDAQ was up a point finishing at 2958. While the Greek stock market fell off a cliff losing 7% of its value, in France the CAC 40 gained 1.7% as traders welcomed President Hollande’s growth over austerity policy.Fitch's reaffirmation of France's AAA rating in the wake of Hollande's victory also helped sentiment.Even Spain’s third largest bank going cap in hand to the Spanish government for bailout cash did little to dampen the mood.This calm is likely to reassure investors in Asia today that the eurozone is no more likely to fall apart than at the height of the financial crisis. But there are still so many unknowns about how a new Greek government will deal with the proposed austerity measures and whether it should exit the euro.Until then we just have a cloud of uncertainty as Greece scrambles to form an interim government before it goose-steps to the polls for a second time in June.",0.03301253542304039,0.9436707496643066,0.023316672071814537
"STI closed 0.9% lower The fall followed four consecutive sessions of gains, and OCBC says tone is likely to remain pessimistic.OCBC Investment Research said:Weak economic data from the US, coupled with declines in European and Chinese manufacturing, triggered investor fears of a global slowdown and led US equities to suffer their second largest fall this year. Goldman Sachs also issued a short call on the S&P 500 with a 1,285 target. Decliners beat advancers four to one on the NYSE with 866m shares exchanging hands.WTI Crude for July delivery fell US$3.25, or 4%, to end at US$78.20/barrel for its worst one-day percentage loss since mid-Dec after the poor economic data slashed prospects for oil demand. Brent for Aug delivery fell as well, losing US$3.46, or 3.7%, to end at US$89.23/barrel.Gold for Aug delivery lost US$50.30, or 3.1%, to end at U$1,565.50/ounce on the back of US dollar strength after the broad market declines. Silver for Jul delivery tracked gold prices lower, shedding US$1.55, or 5.5%, to end at US$26.84/ounce.The sharp plunge on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start (down 0.8% now) likely to spook the local bourse to further losses this morning.As a recap, the STI had already started turning back south yesterday with a 0.9% lower close; this following four prior consecutive sessions of gains.And with today's tone likely to remain pessimistic, we could see the index closing the 2814-2821 immediate gap support; and may even slip further towards the next base at 2800.On the upside, the immediate resistance is now pegged at the 2862 minor peak, with the subsequent vital obstacle marked at the 2900 key support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Equities and other risk assets tumbled as a raft of weak manufacturing data and continued disappointment over the lack of new initiatives from the Fed took hold of global markets. The largest casualty over the last couple of sessions has been oil; Front month WTI is currently well below $80 a barrel after having settled yesterday at its lowest level since the beginning of October 2011. Gold also fell and is now trading at the mid-$1560 level, basically erasing all gains for 2012 for the precious metal.The commodity market space as a whole has officially entered bear market territory, as the S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24 Raw Materials dropped to a day’s low of 558. Since reaching 715 toward the end of February, this general gauge has shed 22%. With growing opinion that not much in the short term can be done to pick up global growth or consumption demand, there is little reason to see this slump ending any time soon.The main beneficiary from all this would seem to be the US consumer and US inflation rates. While commodity prices fall, they will see prices in their stores and petrol pumps reduce. The same might not be true for Asian consumers, as the USD strength means that in local currency terms prices are not dropping as quickly or not at all, with India suffering especially at the hands of a weak currency.The forex markets paint a similar picture to what we have seen in the other asset classes. Risk currencies sold heavily, with Aussie down around 1%, the euro losing 0.9% and sterling off by 0.7% against the greenback. The ten continued to slide against the USD also, as the hopes for a more dovish stance from the BOJ weakens the currency, however most businesses in Japan seem to be in favour of this weakness in the currency.With major eurozone leaders meeting at a summit today, the pressure has been heaped on Merkel as the IMF call for complete monetary union for Europe. With this meeting between Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the German Chancellor might be feeling a little isolated in her views at this meeting. Given the pressure at home, it is unlikely she will change her stance at this meeting. With the sentiment shifting quite sharply back towards the negative, we are looking at an open in Singapore with the STI over 1% lower this morning.",0.01419508270919323,0.9687294363975525,0.017075438052415848
"Flat open expected for the STI; DBS likely to be in focus Is Indonesia’s central bank moving to block DBS from taking over Danamon?IG Markets Singapore said:On the local market DBS is likely to be in focus today after rumours that Indonesia’s central bank will cap bank ownership at under 50%. Many see this as a move to block DBS from taking over Danamon and future foreign banks from taking big stakes in Indonesian banks.CEO Piyush Gupta had been under fire for the planned takeover of the Indonesian bank but shareholders were warming up to the bid. Ironically, he could have the perfect opportunity to walk away from the deal without any shame if Indonesia pushes ahead with the ownership cap.The futures market is pointing to a fairly flat open for the STI this morning.

"STI rebounds but up for weak open The STI closed with a 0.5% gain but is expected to be affected by the Nikkei’s poor start and the closed US market.OCBC Investment Research said:With US market closed for holiday overnight and the Nikkei having a poor start (-0.6% now), these are likely to dent local sentiments this morning.As a recap, the STI rebounded from the 2763 support to a 0.5% gain at the close yesterday. However, this could be technical in nature as the recovery was on the back of very thin volume.With today's tone likely to turn more downside biased, we could see the index slipping back towards the 2763 immediate support (recent trough) again, with the subsequent base marked at the 2730 minor resistance-turned-support.On the upside, the immediate resistance is still pegged at the 2799-2812 gap resistance formed recently, followed by the next obstacle at the 2831 minor peak.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Markets regained some poise yesterday but there's no hiding the fact that the eurozone crisis hasn’t gone away.While Asian markets saw some healthy gains the mood is still very much bearish mixed in with occasional bullishness when traders feel markets have been oversold or a sliver of good news ekes out of the eurozone.Yesterday, we had the slightly more positive news that Greece’s pro-bailout parties are gaining traction. This saw markets unexpectedly rise in Asia while European markets failed to get excited. US markets were closed last night.But next month’s elections are still a wildcard and it’s anyone’s guess what a coalition government will look like.But the markets were calmed yesterday by the rising hopes that Greece may actually stay in the eurozone after all, despite its fate having already been decided two weeks ago. If Greece does avoid a Grexit, economists may soon be referring to its decision to stay as a Greversal (Greek reversal).",0.380780428647995,0.5642654299736023,0.054954178631305695
"STI starting to show signs of fatigue, says OCBC The index failed to sustain itself above 2950 after closing just 0.1% higher at 2948.77.OCBC Investment Research said:With Wall Street shut for a holiday last night, the local bourse is likely to take its cue from the muted showing in Europe yesterday as well as the weak Nikkei start (now down 0.2%)As mentioned earlier, we already noted that the STI is starting to show signs of fatigue; and looks ripe for profit-taking, especially after the recent strong gains of >5% since 27 Jun (>9% since 4 Jun).With the STI having already covered the 2950-2987 gap yesterday, and also failing to sustain itself above 2950 after closing just 0.1% higher at 2948.77, the index could stage a pullback towards 2905.Main hurdle remains at 3000; key support at 2850.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:As the Libor scandal rumbles on and fingers point at more banks, Asia is asking how it may affect investors here. Firstly it should come as no surprise that Barclays is capable of such underhand tactics. British banks have an appalling record for mis-selling products and ripping off customers.Thankfully the fallout from Barclays Libor tampering is likely to be minimal here unless you had a British tracker mortgage linked to Libor, during the period between 2005 and 2009. The scandal may spread to more banks as more details emerge.Many Singaporeans have bought London properties which have been financed by UK lenders. If so check the small print to see what rate the home loan was fixed to.The key here is that Barclays only attempted to influence Libor rates. There is no evidence it was actually successful, yet.The other question is whether Singaporean banks could do the same here with Sibor. Unlikely. The bigger question is why would they bother, given how small the mortgage market is here while Sibor is not recognised as an international benchmark rate.",0.029237350448966026,0.8703165650367737,0.10044614970684052
"STI closes more than 1.2% higher The index benefited from Europe’s strong start, with Singapore the only Asian market still trading when Europe opens.OCBC Investment Research said:The further correction on Wall Street overnight and the negative Nikkei start (-0.4% now) are likely to cue the local bourse to a similar retreat this morning.As a recap, the STI bucked the trend against all major markets yesterday; following a 0.5% higher opening, the index rallied in the afternoon to close more than 1.2% higher.With today's outlook likely to turn a tad more downside biased, we could potentially see the index drifting back towards the 2930 minor trough.Below that, we see the subsequent base at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support. On the upside, 2980 (minor peak) remains the immediate obstacle to overcome, while the next hurdle lies at the 3000 psychological resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In Singapore, the STI shot up 1.2% yesterday buoyed by the strong start by Europe, which eventually faded out. Sometimes there are benefits to being the only Asian market still trading when Europe opens. In the current climate, these occasions are very rare.Today it is in danger of giving up some of these gains with the futures market pointing to a weaker open.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri April 13, 2012 A strong STI open is likely amidst Wall Street recovery and given Singapore’s better-than-expected advance Q1GDP figures.OCBC Investment Research said:The continued recovery on Wall Street overnight and the positive Nikkei start (+0.9% now) are likely to keep local sentiments fairly optimistic this morning.The STI showed some positive signs yesterday following the rebound by US stocks the previous night; after opening more than 0.5% higher, the index rallied further to a 1.1% gain at the close.And with today's tone likely to remain more upside biased, we could see the index continuing its march towards the 2990 minor support-turned-resistance today.Beyond that, the key obstacle is still pegged at the 3030 key peak resistance. On the downside, 2945 (minor trough) is now the immediate support with the subsequent key base pegged at 2900 (key resistance-turned-support).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:In the global economy, investors pushed the “risk on” button last night as Wall Street enjoyed its biggest two-day gain this year. Hints that the earnings season might be better than expected, some rosier economic data and hopes of Fed intervention if the picture turns gloomier all did their bit to help markets surge last night.All the major US markets saw gains of 1.3% and above - the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4% at 12987. The S&P was 1.4% higher at 1388, while the NASDAQ climbed 1.3% to finish at 3056. There was some negative news with US new jobless claims rising but traders decided to focus on the positive data last night. In Europe the FTSE 100 powered up 1.3% while the DAX gained 1%.With investors in a risk-on mood, there were also gains across commodities and risk currencies. We saw major reversals higher in EUR/USD and AUD/USD. Key commodities surged in anticipation of a strong China GDP reading, with copper rising over 2%. USD weakness helped support the commodities.On the energy markets, oil crept up again excited by the prospect that central banks will stimulate economic growth with more monetary easing. WTI gained 0.9% to $103.64 a barrel while Brent gained 1.2% to $121.76.The International Energy Agency (IEA) tried to take the pressure out of the market with its latest report claiming the tightness seen in energy markets over the past two years was beginning to ease. This is clearly at odds with most large oil consuming nations who repeatedly complain about tight supply.This morning we also have China GDP numbers for Q1. Economists have raised the bar slightly and expect them to come in at 8.4%. Observers are still confused as to the true health of the world’s second biggest economy with contradictory and at times questionable data.China needs its economy to slow down while the rest of the world hopes it won’t. China is expected to contribute about two-fifths of global growth this year. Last night’s lending figures hinted at a gradual slowdown.The futures market is signalling a strong start for the STI this morning.

"STI closes 0.1% lower; commodity markets react badly to Bernanke's comments The index was unable to sustain itself above 2770 during an ‘uninspired’ session.OCBC Investment Research said:The muted showing on Wall Street overnight and the weaker Nikkei start (now down 1.2%) could continue to keep local investors sidelined today, especially with the weekend upon us. As a recap, the STI had an uninspired session yesterday, closing 0.1% lower, as investors were reluctant to add further to the previous session’s 1.8% recovery. Inability to sustain itself above 2770 (61.8% retracement of 2605-3035 rally) could herald more near- to medium-term weakness; this could see the index easing back towards 2700 and eventually 2605. Meanwhile, 2800 remains the next significant hurdle.IG Markets meanwhile noted:It was a very eventful night for markets yesterday as they were pulled one way then the other with positive and negative news from the world’s biggest economies.Traders were cheered by China’s surprise cut in is main interest rates while left downbeat from cautious comments from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and a downplaying of the need for fresh stimulus.And in Europe market sentiment edged up a notch with a successful Spanish bond auction only to fall flat after Spain was downgraded three notches to BBB by ratings agency Fitch.This left Wall Street a mixed bag last night. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, NASDAQ fell by the same amount while the S&P 500 ended flat.Europe fared better with the FTSE 100 up 1.2% and the DAX lifting 0.8%.In Asia today markets will be poised to react to China’s decision to cut its interest rates for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis.With May economic data out tomorrow the Chinese authorities may be pre-empting some weak figures with such a rate cut. Up until now the eurozone has been public enemy number one in the global economic recovery, but China could have an even bigger role knocking the final nails in the coffin of a global recovery.Economists have generally been divided on the hard/soft landing debate. However, a few will be shifting to the hard landing side after last night’s cut. Markets are still holding out for a big stimulus package to keep the world’s second biggest economy ticking over with huge infrastructure spending sprees. The current leadership will want to handover a relatively healthy economy to new leaders later this year, but will be mindful of transferring one riddled with more asset bubbles.Asian markets will also be digesting Ben Bernanke’s speech to congress last night. Bernanke prefers to sit on the fence and give the US economy more time to show its true colours before another round of stimulus.But while he is not revealing his cards for QE3 no-one can deny that economic conditions are becoming ripe for more asset purchases. While the eurozone stares into the abyss of negative growth, Bernanke seems to be happy with moderate growth.Commodity markets reacted badly to Bernanke’s comments as gold and oil went south.Gold had rallied on the China rate cut only to drop off 2% after Bernanke failed to mention the Q word. The precious metal has slipped below $1600 to trade at $1592.Oil suffered a double whammy from Bernanke. No announcement on monetary easing coupled with downbeat comments about the growth risks from the eurozone crisis dampened energy markets.",0.16403865814208984,0.8142492771148682,0.021711992099881172
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues April 17, 2012 Markets were mixed on Wall Street and the Nikkei had a soft opening.OCBC Investment Research said:The mixed reactions on Wall Street overnight and the muted Nikkei start (flat now) are unlikely to provide much inspiration to the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI initiated a technical rebound yesterday despite having a poor start; following a 0.6% lower opening, the index recovered steadily for the rest of the session to close around 0.1% in the black.But with today's tone likely to turn more muted, we could see the index consolidating around current levels capped by the 3005 (recent minor peak) immediate resistance.Beyond that, the subsequent key resistance lies at 3030 (key peaks). On the downside, 2945 (recent minor trough) is still the immediate support, followed by the subsequent key base at the 2900 vital resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Singapore equities open this morning to news that the non-oil exports shrunk by 4.3% on a year-on-year basis. Analysts had expected growth of 6.3% highlighting how volatile this data is to predict.The reason for the fall was due to ship structures (down 99%), petrochemicals (down 13%) and primary chemicals (down 15%). Ship structures include oil rigs which can vary massively month to month. But the less volatile sector of electronics grew 2.8% in March while pharmaceuticals rose 43%. With production and new export orders expanding it could signal that the worst is over for Singapore’s manufacturing sector.The fact that exports to the US grew by 4% last month will please traders, who will hope this trend will continue as the world’s largest economy slowly recovers. The STI looks likely to open firmer this morning buoyed by better-than-expected US retail sales.On Wall Street, markets were mixed, with the Dow enjoying gains, the S&P flat and the Nasdaq losing ground. Economic data was also mixed, with US retail sales coming in better than expected, but with the Empire State Manufacturing Index much lower than anticipated.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon May 14, 2012 The STI has shed 4% but a technical rebound is expected for the index.OCBC Investment Research said:Despite the mixed reactions on Wall Street last Friday night, the positive Nikkei index (+0.6% now) might offer some consolation for the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI took a turn for the worse last Friday; after a 0.1% lower opening, the index retreated south persistently to end the day more than 0.7% in the red and breaching the 2900 key resistance-turned-support at the same time.But with today's tone likely to show a slight improvement, we could see the index initiating a technical rebound to retest the 2900 level. A failed retest could result in a quick retreat towards the next support at the 2852-2860 gap support.Above 2900, the subsequent obstacle is pegged at the 2950 support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Traders will be hoping this week starts better than last week after markets tumbled following Greek’s political chaos. But the markets were only pre-empting what might happen and, one week on, these predictions look spot on.Greece looks set to head the polls again next month and talk is growing of the Greeks leaving the eurozone. With this dramatic sort of talk in the air it is likely to lead to some cautious trading sessions this week.Risk-on sentiment wasn’t helped by JP Morgan’s $2 billion of losses that rocked Wall Street on Friday. It wasn’t so much the size of the black hole but the fact that trading desks can still so quickly and easily run up such debts.The timing wasn’t great either with so many dark clouds hanging over the global economy in the shape of a possible Greek eurozone exit, shaky Spanish banks and weak Chinese trade figures. Friday saw US consumer confidence hit its highest level for four years but this did little to lift markets revealing just how downbeat they are with so much uncertainty present.Investors are unlikely to see a turnaround this week but will be keeping their fingers crossed that we see no repeat performance from last week’s dismal performance across global markets.The STI shed 4% last week and had the double whammy of Greek uncertainty mixed in with local concerns following some poor Q1 corporate earnings from some of the economy’s biggest hitters.The futures markets is pointing to a weaker opening for the STI this morning.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon April 16, 2012 Traders in Singapore are looking at global markets following the retreat on Wall Street and with China’s GDP growth lower than analysts’ expectations.OCBC Investment Research said:The retreat on Wall Street last Friday night and the negative Nikkei start (-1.2% now) are likely to dent local sentiments this morning.Despite a relatively strong rebound with a 0.7% higher opening in the previous session, The STI gave up most of its earlier gains to end just 0.3% in the black on Friday.And with today's tone likely to turn more downside biased, we could see the index slipping further south in the direction of the 2945 (recent minor trough) immediate support.Below that, the key base still lies at the 2900 vital resistance-turned-support. On the upside, 3005 (Friday's intraday high) is now the immediate obstacle to overcome, followed by the subsequent key resistance at 3030 (key peaks).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Last week was one of the most volatile for global markets as they dipped from US employment figures, rose again with hopes of Fed intervention and then fell on Friday with China’s lower-than-expected GDP numbers.The STI also dipped in and out of the red last week but finished higher on Friday after Singaporean GDP figures came in stronger-than-expected. But local traders will look to global markets this morning and see how early-year optimism has started to fade.All eyes had been on the US and an economy creating jobs and lifting market sentiment. This played its part in the rally equities enjoyed in Q1. But betting all your chips on the US economy steadily and consistently recovering is looking an increasingly risky bet.The one bright spark has been US corporate earnings which are looking firmer. Google and now JPMorgan have already pleased shareholders but this wasn’t enough to overshadow the downbeat macro-economic data.Traders are now shifting their attention east to China, swiftly bypassing Europe, as the possible next catalyst to drive markets higher. While China’s GDP growth at 8.1% was slightly lower than analysts’ expectations of 8.4% it wasn’t all bad news.Retail sales, industrial production and car sales have all picked up while bank lending surged last month. There is a strong argument for China’s GDP growth to have now bottomed out.But for the here-and-now the focus is on the lowest economic growth for three years and the markets are far from delighted. But traders may be forgetting the fact that the Chinese government isn’t just watching as a powerless spectator. It will act if and when it feels the time is right in a number of ways, the most obvious being monetary easing.On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1% at 12850. The S&P was 1.3% lower at 1370, while the NASDAQ shed 1.5% to finish at 3011. Spain also joins China as economies that are a permanent fixture on traders’ radar screens. Yields on Spanish government debt have breached 6% and are spooking markets a little too soon after the Greek debt crisis was temporarily averted.The eurozone still needs time to combine its financial stability packages and restore a little investor confidence before it can better handle the next crisis.

This sort of downturn may attract bargain hunters into the market this month, although they may be looking for bigger falls before they brave risk assets again.On the commodities market economic bellwether copper continues to slide while oil futures fell 17% during May capping the biggest monthly decline for three-and-a-half years. Brent crude slipped 0.5% last night to $101.61 a barrel which will please the Saudi Arabian oil ministry which had targeted a price below the $100 threshold.WTI slumped 1.5% last night and trades at $86.53 as US employment data revealed more weaknesses in the economic recovery story.On the local market, DBS may be in the spotlight after Indonesia’s central bank said it would cap single ownership in its banks to 40% for new investments. This will surely see the Danaomon bid scrapped with such tight restrictions.Formula One is to put its planned IPO in Singapore in the pits for the time due to such choppy markets.

"STI set for firmer open but negative US index futures could cap gains The index ended 0.3% higher on Tuesday after rebounding from a lower 0.9% opening.OCBC Investment Research said:The recovery on Wall Street overnight and positive Nikkei start (now up 0.4%) are likely to keep local sentiments fairly buoyant this morning. However, the negative US index futures (-0.2% now) could cap the gains by the STI; the index had already ended 0.3% higher yesterday after rebounding from a lower 0.9% opening.For now, we continue to see the immediate support at around 2735 (minor trough), with the subsequent base lying at the 2700 level (major trough in Jun '12).On the upside, the 2800 psychological level still pose as the initial hurdle, with the next resistance pegged at the 2830 minor peak.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Hopes of more monetary stimulus acted as a safety net last night to stop markets tumbling as eurozone leaders failed to inspire investors.Bullish talk of quantitative easing from Fed Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans lifted US markets last night. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ both gained 1.2%.European bourses also curbed losses with hopes of more stimulus from EU policy makers. The FTSE 100 lifted 0.8% while the DAX and CAC 40 saw modest gains.Looking at these figures, few would guess the impending doom many investors are predicting for the eurozone. The more pessimistic among us are anticipating a Greek exit followed by the likes of Spain, Italy, Ireland and anyone wanting to break free of the shackles of EU/IMF austerity measures.But even for the more upbeat investor, confidence in a workable and accepted solution seems to be slipping away like sand in an egg timer. The ECB has given its backing for a three-pronged attack on the crisis – increasing supervision of lenders, establishing a deposit guarantee scheme and asking for contributions from the financial industry.But this is still some way off, unlikely to see a smooth passage of acceptance, and even then, there’s no guarantee it will do enough to restore confidence in the beleaguered eurozone. Of more immediate concern is the Greek elections looming large on Sunday. Markets are still divided on whether this will spark a Greek exit by choice, or if the Greeks will be forced out at a later date. Investors have taken their eye off the ball on this monumental event for the future of the European economic community, distracted by the Spanish banking bailout and Italy heading the same way as its continental neighbours.After the Spanish bank bailout fell flat on its face, investors are beginning to grow tired of these short-term fixes and want something more substantial and long-term from policy makers. This is clearly evident in the bond markets as Spanish bonds have now reached an euro-era high peaking at 6.8%. Obviously, €100 billion doesn’t get you very far these days.As sentiment remained shaky last night we saw the inevitable flight to safety. Gold caught some of the safe haven tailwinds last night rising about 1% to trade at $1612 an ounce this morning.The euro has remained resilient trading in a tight range on the $1.25 handle. IG Markets has almost two-thirds of our clients shorting the single currency.On the energy markets oil continues to trade sideways. Opec leaders meet tomorrow to discuss supply levels with Saudi Arabia facing some tough opposition to increase output by 500,000 a day.US Crude edged up to $83.32 while Brent has come off a little to sit at $97.11.On the local stock market Olam may be one to watch after announcing a joint venture with a US firm to supply Canadian grain and oilseed.

"Conservative outlook prevails for Taiwan's Money Market Funds Taiwanese MMFs are constrained by their concentration on the domestic financial sector, comprising over 90% of assets.In a release by Fitch Ratings-Taipei/Singapore-03 April 2012, Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the ratings of Taiwanese money market funds (MMFs) should remain stable in the foreseeable future, after regulatory changes have helped reduce the risk profile of their investment portfolios. Fitch expects rated Taiwanese MMFs to maintain strong underlying credit quality.""Taiwanese MMFs' risk profile has improved noticeably in recent years after the implementation of stricter regulations to limit their eligible investment assets and maturity exposures,"" says Jonathan Lee, Senior Director in Fitch's Financial Institutions Group. ""The growth prospect of Taiwanese MMFs will remain constrained as their search for short-dated, high quality assets is hampered by a limited supply of qualified securities domestically.""The ratings of Taiwanese MMFs reflect their strong asset quality and short maturity profile, but are constrained by concentration on the domestic financial sector (over 90% of MMFs' assets). Such concentration could expose the funds to the risk of a rapid weakening of asset quality in a bank systemic risk event.Fitch currently rates Taiwanese MMFs on its Bond Fund Rating Scale, rather than its MMF Rating Scale. This reflects potential exposure to lowly-rated assets ('BBB' category) and the limitation of the funds' liquidity profile (in terms of maturity, the liquidity buffer, and concentration in the domestic private financial sector).The report entitled 'Taiwanese Money Market Funds: More Conservative Profile but Little Room for Growth' is available at www.fitchratings.com.",0.6757717728614807,0.21749334037303925,0.10673490166664124
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues April 10, 2012 A weaker open looms for the STI with the ASX 200 already down 1% and Wall Street suffering more fallout from the US jobs data.IG Markets Singapore said:Is the party over for 2012’s stock market rally which was fuelled by cheap credit and false hopes of a US economic recovery? While this may sound alarmist, it is the sort of sentiment that is rife on trading floors as markets continue to head south.Last night Wall Street suffered more fallout from the weaker-than-expected jobs data which has sent shivers down the spines of bulls who had pinned so much hope on non-farm payrolls data pointing the way to a global economic recovery gathering pace with the US in the driving seat.The S&P 500 dropped 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%.Europe would have gone the same way had most bourses not been closed for the Easter break. Asia definitely felt the chilly winds of investor panic yesterday, with major regional markets sliding.They weren’t helped by Chinese inflation creeping up for March which could limit the options available for the PBOC for further monetary easing. All this disappointment highlights the fact that any global economic recovery won’t be happening in a straight line. There will be blips and setbacks along the way. Hopefully March’s non-farm payroll data is one such blip and not the start of a downward trend.China will be in the spotlight again this morning when it releases its trade balance figures for March. They can’t come in any worse than February’s which showed a huge deficit of $31.5bn. The smart money is on a significant narrowing of the trade deficit last month, now that seasonal distortions are taken out of the equation. February also saw China stockpile on commodities as prices were starting to rise, which inflated its import figures.But in hindsight this hasn’t worked out that well as commodities have since slipped. WTI crude briefly fell below $101 a barrel last night before recovering to $102.26. Brent is at $122.15 as more downward pressure is put on oil prices with faltering US employment, rising stockpiles and Iran due to take a seat at a very long negotiating table.US copper futures fell more than 2%, as a global economic recovery now looks frustratingly slow, like a tortoise crossing the road.In Singapore, Genting is likely to be a well talked about company with its perpetual bond issue kicking off today. It hopes to raise $500 million from a retail investor initiative, offering a yearly distribution rate of 5.125%.The funds will go towards possible expansion across Asia. Given Genting’s track record and the poor rates of interest in savings accounts, investors are likely to be queuing round the block for this one.While the Nikkei Average has opened slightly higher this morning the ASX 200 is already down 1%. The futures market points to a weaker open for the STI this morning.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:Although US stocks fell more than 1% overnight, the local bourse which has already seen a similar heavy pullback yesterday, is likely to derive some mild optimism from the positive Nikkei start (+0.4% now).The STI, which took cue from the sharply lower US index futures yesterday morning, plunged nearly 0.8% at the open before slipping to a 0.9% loss by the close.But with today's tone likely to show some near term improvements, we could see the index initiating a technical rebound back in the direction of the now support-turned-resistance at 2975 for a test.Beyond this immediate obstacle, the subsequent key resistance still lies at the 3030 recent major peaks. On the downside, the immediate support is now pegged at 2945 (resistance-turned-support), followed by the key base at the 2900 resistance-turned-support.",0.01429081428796053,0.9654753804206848,0.020233800634741783
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs May 17, 2012 Soft open is expected for the STI following further losses on Wall Street and the negative Nikkei start.OCBC Investment Research said:The further losses on Wall Street overnight and the negative Nikkei start (-0.2% now) could continue to weigh on local sentiments this morning.As a recap, the STI retreated sharply again yesterday following its failed attempt to retake the 2900 level on Tuesday; after opening some 0.3% lower, the index plunged to a 1.6% loss by the close.And with today's tone unlikely to see any significant improvements, we could expect the index to inch further south towards the immediate key resistance-turned-support at 2800. Below that, the next base lies at the 2750 minor trough.On the upside, 2900 is still the immediate key support-turned-resistance, with the subsequent obstacle pegged at the 2950 support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Wall Street has turned decidedly bearish on equities as traders decide the eurozone crisis now presents too big a danger. Fund managers and institutional investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets as the eurozone looks likely it will implode inspired by the Greek political fallout.All this doesn’t bode well for Asian markets will are already suffering from this sharp turn in risk sentiment. Yesterday regional bourses took another tumble with the STI extending its losses to more than 5% since the first Greek election results.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3% at 12599. The S&P was 0.4% lower at 1325, while the NASDAQ retreated 0.7% to close at 2874. US markets had traded in positive territory earlier in the session thanks to some upbeat economic data as housing starts and industrial production beat expectations.There was even talk of monetary policy easing (QE3) as more members said they would back another round of cheap liquidity if conditions dictated. Even this talk of QE3 did little to lift US stocks highlighting just how concerned investors are right now with the eurozone crisis of confidence. Things in Europe took a turn for the worst last night over reports that the ECB will freeze lending to some Greek banks. This spooked investors who are seeing a slow and steady trickle of deposits out of Greek banks. Markets are likely to remain choppy until we get some hard and fast answers on whether Greece will leave the eurozone and who else might follow. With a second election one month away markets will remain choppy with rumour and speculation.Some traders may be sitting this one out with seasickness while others will be going on fishing trips looking to catch some bargains among oversold stocks.",0.012348588556051254,0.9689782857894897,0.018673092126846313
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Jan 26, 2012 Looks like a positive opening awaits the local bourse.OCBC Investment Research said:The recovery on Wall Street overnight is likely to cue the local bourse to a positive opening this morning.Following Wednesday's 1.4% surge, the STI marched on strongly yesterday; it gapped up nearly 0.5% at the open before rallying to a 1.5% higher close.And with today's tone likely to remain more upside biased, we could see the index inching towards the vital resistance at around 2910 (key support-turned-resistance and 200-DMA) for a test; however, it is likely that the index could face fairly strong selling pressure near this region.Beyond that, the subsequent obstacle can be found at the 3000 key psychological level. On the downside, the immediate support is now pegged at the 2852-2860 (gap support formed yesterday), with the subsequent base marked at the 2793 resistance-turned-support.Meanwhile RBS noted:The USD sold off sharply against the G10 after the FOMC elected to extend the guidance on the Fed funds rate, and now expects an exceptionally low Fed funds rate through late 2014 at least. EUR/USD traded to above 1.31 during the afternoon after falling to below 1.2950 as NY walked in this morning, breaking above the key resistance level 1.3080 (previous 2011 high) and the 50-day moving average at 1.3095.We wrote in Global Currency Weekly that we expect the short EUR squeeze to continue and while we retain a negative outlook, would be hesitant to re-enter EUR shorts at these levels. The FOMC statement also seemed to lean dovish and state the case for additional QE, which propelled the commodity currencies, US Equities and gold to close near their highs of the session.While we do expect additional Fed QE in around mid-year, relatively the ECB and BoE are likely to resume balance sheet expansion during February (RBS forecasts MPC initiates QE in February and the ECB holds its second 3-year LTRO operation 29 February), which should limit upside for EUR and GBP over the near-term.GFT, on the other hand, said:All the commodity currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar today as risk appetite improved. Australia’s core inflation rate accelerated above the middle of the central bank’s 2 percent to 3 percent annual target range last quarter.As a result, traders pared bets on another interest-rate reduction next month. The trimmed mean consumer price index advanced to 2.6 percent from the third quarter, when it rose to a revised 2.4 percent.European debt troubles remain a possible catalyst for another interest rate cut later down the road as inflation figures don’t seem to warrant back-to-back cuts. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand announced today that it is keeping its official cash rate unchanged at 2.5 percent. Since the last central bank meeting financial market sentiment has slightly improved, however, concerns about global growth still loom. Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard noted that exports have remained elevated, but the appreciation in the New Zealand dollar is cutting into exporters’ profits. As for the economic outlook, the central bank sees a modest recovery in household spending and the housing market. Furthermore, repairs and reconstruction in Canterbury will provide a material boost for the economy. Inflation in the New Zealand economy remains well contained and is not a concern at the moment.",0.8109352588653564,0.1466720849275589,0.04239267483353615

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Feb 23, 2012 There was retreat on Wall Street and the Nikkei started weak.OCBC Investment Research said:The retreat on Wall Street overnight and the weak Nikkei start (-0.2% now) are likely to dent local sentiments further this morning.Following a 0.4% loss at the open yesterday, the STI fell below the 3000 key support to end nearly 1% in the red at its intraday low.And with today's tone likely to remain more downside biased, we could see the index continue its near term downside momentum and trend lower in the direction of the 2950 immediate support (recent minor trough).Below that, the subsequent base lies at the 2931-2939 gap support. On the upside, the 3000 psychological level has become the immediate resistance again with the next obstacle now pegged at around 3050 (support-turned-resistance).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The STI will be hoping to put yesterday’s dismal performance behind it today although it will be pushing against strong headwinds.After the 1% slump and the symbolic drop back below the 3000 level many will be wondering if the bull run that has seen the STI put on more than 13% so far this year has run out of steam.The initial catalyst of a Greek deal being struck pushed markets higher, along with a generally more upbeat outlook for the global economy. But this is no longer providing the stimulus the bulls need to sustain the run. Instead we are seeing a bit of a lull as traders take some time out to assess the year so far and predict which way things will go, while taking some profits with them. The global economy is indeed in a healthier shape this year compared to the end of last year, the problem is there’s still a long way to go on the road to recovery.RBS, on the other hand, reported::Risk-seeking sentiment was broadly subdued following weaker than expected European PMI releases overnight.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri Feb 10, 2012 Nikkei suffers weak start while modest gains are reported on Wall Street.OCBC Investment Research said:The modest gains on Wall Street overnight and a weak Nikkei start (-0.3% now) are unlikely to provide much inspiration to the local bourse this morning.As such, the STI which ended flat yesterday, could continue to consolidate around current levels today.At the moment, 3000 key psychological resistance is still the toughest obstacle to overcome in the near term. The subsequent resistance is pegged at the 3070 support-turned-resistance.On the downside, the 2931-2939 gap support is still the initial base to watch out for, with the subsequent support at 2874 (recent trough).Meanwhile RBS noted:EUR/USD received a slight boost from the ECB press conference and reached a high during the session of 1.3322 before settling into a narrow range for the rest of the session. Several other USD pairs also were relatively rangebound with the notable exception of USD/JPY.USD/JPY steadily moved higher and hit an intraday peak of 77.73 and remains near that level at the time of writing. USD /JPY has climbed significantly above the level implied by the 5-year swap rate spread and could suggest that the BOJ is conducting more ""stealth intervention.""Accordingly, we remain reluctant to chase USD/JPY higher at current levels and recommended taking profit in our long CAD/JPY exposure at 78.05, realizing a 3.1% gain (including carry) from the initial recommendation at 75.75 on 5 January.GFT, on the other hand, reported:After months of anticipation, the Greeks finally got their act together and agreed to all of the Trioka’s harsh austerity measures but unfortunately it was not enough. The announcement of a Greek deal should have had a big impact on the EUR/USD but the currency pair’s gains were limited by the amount of the concerns from the IMF and other Eurozone nations. Rather than applauding the breakthrough by the Greeks, European leaders spent most of their airtime expressing skepticism. The problem is that Greece has not provided sufficient information to assure creditors that their deficit reduction targets can be met and therefore it has been impossible for Euro area Finance Ministers to make a quick decision on releasing aid. The IMF in particular is worried about any potential changes in economic policies if a new leader is chosen in the April elections. They also want Greece to implement plans that they pledged in return for the first bailout payments before providing additional financing. Eurozone nations who had already been reluctant about greater financial commitments were quick to signal that if the IMF doesn’t have faith in Greece, neither do they. Germany’s Finance Minister said that the Greek deal on spending cuts is “insufficient” because their plans to cut spending are not enough to fulfill bailout conditions. Ireland’s Finance Minister also agreed that there are “gaps” in the “logic” of the Greek deal and so he cannot say that a deal has been completed.The IMF appears to share this view according to Gerry Rice, the head of IMF communication who said the next step is to continue discussions with the Greek authorities and European partners on the overall program. Other countries such as Austria also want to see the implementation of the first package before approving a second.With so much opposition, an immediate endorsement of Eurozone Finance Ministers appears unlikely and an approval by the German Parliament is far from a done deal. Rather than diminishing the uncertainty, the Greek deal raised more questions and highlighted the amount of hurdles that need to be overcome for Greece to avoid a default. The price action of the EUR/USD suggests that even though investors may be nervous, they remain optimistic that everything will be sorted out by March 20th because no one wants to witness a Greek default. In the meantime, expect the Greek debt deal to continue to dominate the headlines and the market’s appetite for euros over the next 24 hours.",0.5639292001724243,0.3905114233493805,0.04555940628051758
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed Feb 8, 2012 Mid-week trading is welcomed by good news.OCBC Investment Research said:With US stocks ending higher overnight and the Nikkei 225 index initiating a fairly strong start (+0.6% now), these are likely to inspire the local bourse as well this morning.Following the bullish break above the 2920 vital resistance last Friday, the STI climbed further yesterday; this after it opened 0.2% higher before rallying to a 0.6% gain at the close. And with today's sentiments likely to remain buoyant, we could see the index inching higher towards the immediate obstacle at the 3000 psychological resistance, with the subsequent resistance pegged at 3070 (support-turned-resistance). On the downside, the 2931-2939 gap support is still the initial base to watch out for, with the subsequent support at 2874 (recent trough).Meanwhile GFT reported:Currencies and equities performed extremely well today with the EUR/USD rising to its highest level since December. The S&P 500 also hit an 8 month high but the performance of technology stocks was the most spectacular with the Nasdaq composite reaching levels last seen in December 2000.The rally in risk was sparked by hope that this will be week that Greece finally announces a PSI deal. Bernanke’s bearish comments also helped by driving the U.S. dollar lower. The head of the U.S. central bank has not been swayed by the latest non-farm payrolls report and based on his continued concerns, QE3 is still on the table.The prospect of more stimulus and the continuation of easy monetary policy helped U.S. equities turn positive for the day. As much as we can point out that today’s rally is based on nothing more than hope, the EUR/USD has performed extremely well, breaking out of its weeklong consolidation.The fact that the U.S. dollar weakened against every major currency except for the Japanese Yen confirms that today’s rally is supported by an improvement in risk appetite. Whether the EUR/USD is able to hold onto its gains will be largely determined by developments in the coming days. RBS, on the other hand, noted:Even though today's data was minor, it continued to reinforce the trend of firming domestic data alongside rising global risk appetites. This is most clearly seen in European space, where our desk reported real money buying of semi-core and periphery and selling of Germany.Equities continue to benefit as well, so the only surprise is perhaps that yields are not even higher than they are now, with 10s still below 2%.

"HK-listed firm keen to buy “illiquid” SG-listed SMB United at $0.32 per share The offer according to the acquiring firm Boer Power is competitively priced compared to the current valuations of French power giant Schneider.“Basically the offer is very fair. The current marketing condition is very negative and Boer is not taking advantage of that to offer a reduced price. We are also taking consideration of global leading players in the same industry such as Schneider .The $0.32 per share offer implies a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 11.5x while Schneider currently trades at 10.9x PE according to data released on Bloomberg. This despite the fact that Schneider has a much larger base of operations compared to SMB United, offering a full range of services,” Boer Power chairman and CEO Qian Yixiang.told Singapore Business Review.In a separate interview, Boer Power’s financial advisor PrimePartners director Mah How Soon reiterated that the offer is attractive saying that when evaluated against the historical trading shares of SMB, the offer represents a premium of approximately 16% over the last transacted price per share, 17% over the last one month, 21% over the last three months and 28% over the last twelve months prior to the last trading day before the Offer Announcement.Mr. Mah also noted that the offer is even fair enough for a stock that is basically ‘illiquid’.” “SMB’s daily trading liquidity is just less than 1% of the free float and the total share capital of SMB over the last 12 months. In fact, SMB United shares only closed above the Offer Price of $0.32 on 53 trading days over the last 5 years,” he said.Boer according to Mr. Mah intends to acquire to 100% of shares SMB. In the event that Boer gets more than 90% shareholding interests including the acceptance, Boer will exercise its right of compulsory acquisition. Mr. Qian however notes that if the acquisition was successful, subject to a comprehensive review of the organization, business and operations of SMB, there are currently no plans to impose major changes in the management or cut down the number of employees.“We envisage no significant change in the business and management as Boer recognizes the management and employees of SMB,” said Mr. Qian.For this offer to shareholders of SMB, Mr. Mah said that Boer wants to achieve the following strategies• To expand channel overseas by tapping SMB’s channels in Europe, China and the rest of• Asia.• To increase product offering as Boer and SMB are basically in the same industry and they have complementary products.• To improve operational efficiency and other improvement measures.• To attract talents as the acquisition will bring Boer and SMB in a better position to attract talents.Boer dispatched the offer on Nov. 21 and is open for acceptances and closes at 5:30 p.m. (Singapore time) on 19 December 2011 or such later date(s) as may be announced.",0.06652669608592987,0.03757864981889725,0.8958945870399475

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed March 21, 2012 Bad economic news from China dragged trading both in Europe and the US.IG Markets Singapore said:The STI could be in for a choppy day of trading today after a disappointing night across Europe and Wall Street spurred by China’s fuel price hike and commodity-consumption slowdown.Attention has now well and truly swung towards China which can be labelled “the new Europe” as it now the main source of bad economic news and trader concerns.While an IMF official this week ruled out a hard landing for China, others are not so sure after more cracks appeared in its supposedly managed slowdown. Yesterday BHP Billiton said it was seeing signs of a “flattening” iron ore demand from China as the economy continues to cool.US markets came off four-year highs, as risk appetite slumped. Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5% at 13170. The S&P was 0.3% lower at 1406 and the NASDAQ shed 0.1% to finish at 3074. European markets had an even tougher session with the FTSE, CAC and DAX all slumping over 1% each.RBS meanwhile noted (for 20 March 2012 trading):The ""rally"" in 10s belies the tone of the market, which remains poor. 10yr yields at their best were at 2.33% (almost 5bps lower in yield on the day), but were unable to sustain the bid. This, despite lower equities, and lower commodities after an overnight of Chinese growth concerns.In sum, just about everything was down: bonds, stocks, and commodities. There are glimmers of positives however – for while unable to sustain a rally neither did the market break down when 5yr yields moved above their key 1.20% level.We heard of stops (mostly futures) when this occurred but a relatively tame move occurred and 5yrs subsequently fell back below 1.20%. The price action speaks of a potential balance in the market, at key supports and with the market in the short term quite oversold.We always prefer to see momentum turn bullishly before sounding the all clear, so for another day we watch the market and tenuously hold to the belief that a fundamental change has not taken place, and the market is in the process of tracing out its higher rate range which will hold for the next few weeks.OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, reported:The correction on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start (-0.3% now) are likely to dent local sentiments this morning.Following the relatively sharp correction from the 3030 resistance on Monday, the STI initiated a mild technical rebound yesterday. After opening 0.4% higher, the index consolidated around that region before ending the day at its opening value.But with today's tone likely to deteriorate again, we could see the index continuing its slide in the direction of the 2960 minor trough.Below that, we still see the key base at the 2900 (key resistance-turned-support). On the upside, 3030 remains the firm immediate key obstacle to overcome, followed by the subsequent resistance at 3065 (trough in Jul '11).",0.01274314895272255,0.9665646553039551,0.020692171528935432

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon March 5, 2012 Last Friday's session in the US was muted and the Nikkei started flat.OCBC Investment Research said:The local bourse is unlikely to get any inspiration from the muted US closing on Friday, as well as the dull Nikkei start (currently flat).Instead, we may start to see some modest profit-taking on Friday’s 0.5% gains, especially since the index has again failed to hold above the key 3000 level.Daily technical indicators are also looking mildly negative – we note that the MACD has been negative since 21 Feb and that was when the index hit the YTD high of 3031.As such, there is a risk that the STI could ease back towards 2950 (30-day moving average), ahead of 2931 (23.6% retracement of rally from 2606 to 3031). We continue to peg 3000 as the initial cap, ahead of 3011 (where the STI could trigger a bullish parabolic buy signal).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:The STI could be taking a breather from the roller-coaster start to the year or this may be the calm before the storm. Whatever the reason, the market has been decidedly lacklustre as of late with lower volumes and a lack of direction.Last week the STI failed to get going despite a mixture of positive and negative news from the US and Europe. However, it still ended Friday in positive territory, up 0.5% in what was a subdued week. But given this was a week where €530 billion of cheap money flooded into Europe, traders may have been hoping for a better response. No such cheap money is expected this week, although you never know while the US, Europe, China and Japan still have the keys to their central bank’s vault doors in their pockets.Lacklustre looks to be the buzzword this week and US and European markets definitely lacked any sort of sparkle, or gains, after Friday’s session pointing to a quiet start in Asia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and FTSE 100 all drifted in Friday’s trade.However, the US is on course to be the darling of world equities this week with non-farm payroll data on Friday hinting at an expansion of more than 200,000 jobs in February. Although a week is a long time for global markets and anything could dampen sentiment between now and Friday.RBS, on the other hand, reported:A quiet data calendar led to a muted session in risk-seeking sentiment, as US Equities sold off while Treasuries and the USD rallied. Canadian 2011 4Q and December GDP were the only releases of note. The S&P 500 slid only 4 points but failed to post a weekly close above the 2011 high 1370.58.",0.07667212188243866,0.8795362114906311,0.04379165917634964
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed Jan 25, 2012 The local bourse is not likely to get much help from the happenings on Wall Street and the Nikkei.OCBC Investment Research said:The muted reactions on Wall Street overnight and the mild positive Nikkei start (+0.4% at the moment) are unlikely to provide any significant cues to the local bourse this morning.Following the sharp 1.4% rally last Friday and with most local investors probably still taking an extended break from the festive holidays, the STI could potentially face some profit-taking pressure from short-term traders today.Nevertheless, the 2793 immediate support (resistance-turned-support) remains a fairly strong base at the moment, with the subsequent support pegged at 2735 (minor resistance-turned-support and 100-DMA).On the upside, we still see the vital resistance at around 2910 (key support-turned-resistance), with the subsequent obstacle marked at the 3000 key psychological level.Meanwhile FX Strategist at RBS noted:The early trade was risk off, mainly due to Greek PSI concerns, but this was steadily reversed throughout the NY session as optimism continues to be the underlying theme for global markets (aided by today's Richmond Fed release).Many of the European bank shares, which led the down-trade in European stocks, ended the day in a range of +2% to -3% - after being -5% to -7% when I walked in. Treasuries lost their early bid, but the reaction was tepid; overall I would describe today as a pause ahead of the FOMC tomorrow, and some consolidation after 4 straight days of lower prices.We saw two way flows in the front end, fast money selling in 7s, two way from foreign real money in the 5yr area, and central bank selling of 3s. The swaps desk saw receiving in the belly of 5s10s30s fly and curve spread steepeners. They also noted that there was a good receiver in long end spreads away.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon Feb 27, 2012 There were continued gains on Wall Street and the Nikkei started strong.OCBC Investment Research said:The stronger Nikkei start (currently +0.7%) on the back of continued gains on Wall Street is likely to inspire a similar opening for the local bourse this morning.Traders are also likely to be pleased to note that the STI, which closed 0.3% higher Friday, managed to stay above 2957 (61.8% retracement of fall from 3227 to 2521). Daily technical indicators though remain slightly mixed – the RSI is still to show signs of a rebound just above the 50% mark; but MACD continues to trend lower at the recent negative crossover; stochastic still shows the market as being overbought.Hence, the index may still have a tough time clearing the key 3000 level; any failure is likely to be taken as a signal to take profit. Otherwise, the next resistance can be found at 3044 (upper Bollinger band).On the downside, we peg the initial support at 2957, ahead of 2883 (lower Bollinger Band). GFT, on the other hand, noted:It will be an extremely busy trading week for the euro that could seal the currency’s fate for weeks to come. Aside from the LTRO, Germany will also be voting on the second bailout for Greece and Eurozone finance ministers will be meeting ahead of Thursday’s EU Leaders summit.There is scope for some big announcements but also room for disappointment. If we assume no new developments for Greece – which is quite possible considering that everyone wants to wait and see how much participation there is for the bond swap, then the main event risk will be the central bank’s long term refinancing operation.The ECB’s first LTRO kicked off a sharp rally in equities that drove the DJIA above 13,000. Expectations for more stimulus from the ECB is part of the reason why equities powered higher and the size of next (this) week's LTRO will determine whether the risk rally continues.RBS meanwhile reported:Flows were quiet today (Friday), as reflected in the fact that Total Treasury broker volume today (Friday) was 74% of the 10-day average.Treasuries traded near unchanged for the bulk of the session, with 10yr yields putting in a 4bps range since yesterday's (Thursday) close. Most notable was the outperformance of the 30yr, as investors look ahead to month end as well as the Fed purchase operations between now and then.Contributing to the quiet nature of the day was the fact that, for once, there is not a lot of weekend risk surrounding Greece or other risk factors, unless you count to ongoing tension with Iran. Speaking of which, the trajectory of retail gas prices is increasingly uncomfortable.",0.21196557581424713,0.7101601362228394,0.0778743103146553
"Here's what you missed last night Wall Street up, Singapore should open strong.Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed Jan 11, 2012.- OCBC Investment Research noted continued gains on Wall Street should put a positive spin on the local bourse this morning.But with the index already up 1.1% yesterday, further gains may slow, especially ahead of likely tough hurdle around 2733 region (early Jan intraday high, also near 50-day & 100-day moving averages).On the downside, 2700 remains the key support; the STI still needs to demonstrate its ability to sustain above this level before the broader market confidence returns.Expectations for monetary easing in China and a stronger Euro boosted US equities and other dollar-denominated commodities with the financial and materials sectors performing the best. Advancers beat out decliners more than three to one on the NYSE with 840m shares exchanging hands.- Kathy Lien, Director of Currency research for GFT, noted USD/JPY continues to maintain its usual grind by trading in a very tight range. EU Commissioner Rehn was on the wires earlier this morning saying that Eurobonds could rival U.S. Treasuries as a safe haven. Although the introduction of Eurobonds could provide a strong solution for the region, it has very little support by key players.With very little on the docket for the rest of the day, short EUR/USD positions could be squeezed further as long as U.S. equities maintain their gains.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues Feb 7, 2012 It seems like there’s nothing to jump about at least this morning.OCBC Investment Research said:The muted reactions on Wall Street overnight and the mildly lower Nikkei start (-0.2% now) are likely to cue the local bourse to a relatively quiet start this morning.As a recap, the STI finally conquered the stubborn 2920 key resistance yesterday following numerous failed attempts. Following a strong 1.1% gap-up above this key obstacle at the open, the index held on to much of its gains to end the day 0.8% higher.But with today's outlook likely to turn more cautious, we could see the index trading around current levels and possibly even ease towards the 2931-2939 gap support which was formed yesterday.Below this initial base, we see the subsequent support at around 2874 (recent trough). On the upside, we now peg the immediate obstacle at the 3000 psychological resistance, followed by the subsequent resistance at 3070 (support-turned-resistance).GFT, on the other hand, reported:Since it is quiet week for U.S. economic data, the dollar will predominately trade on risk appetite. Today, U.S. stocks recovered much of its earlier losses to end the day only slightly lower. At the start of the North American trading session, the dollar strengthened against all of the major currencies but by the day’s end, it was only higher against the euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Australian and New Zealand dollars. The greenback turned negative against the euro and the Japanese Yen. Meanwhile RBS noted:With equities unchanged and the Greek PSI situation still unresolved, there was muted risk-seeking sentiment among the G10 currencies versus the USD. The USD, though, weakened modestly in the morning versus the EUR, GBP and CHF before settling into narrow ranges for the remainder of the session.The lack of conviction in broader risk sentiment amid a relatively quiet session with minimal data releases helped restrain CAD upside despite a positive surprise in the Canadian Ivey PMI.AUD also traded tightly against the USD and the NZD for the majority of the session ahead of the RBA decision, where RBS is in the minority in expecting no change in the policy rate (consensus: 25bp cut).",0.14325504004955292,0.828523576259613,0.02822142466902733
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Jan 12, 2012 Profit-taking is likely in Singapore as US equities recover from early session losses.- OCBC Investment Research said mixed US close overnight and softer Nikkei start (down 0.3%) could spark profit-taking in the local bourse today, especially after the STI’s 2.1% rally since Tue.Daily stochastic indicator also suggests that the market looks slightly overbought; although RSI and MACD indicators remain largely positive.As such, we could see a minor retracement to 2727 (50-day moving average), but 2700 level is expected to hold.On the upside, 2800 remains the key hurdle, but the index could run into pretty stiff resistance around 2793 (early Dec 11 high, also 38.2% retracement of fall from 3227-2521).US equities recovered from early session losses to finish slightly higher as investor sentiment fluctuated between European debt concerns and an improving US economy. Advancers inched ahead of decliners on the NYSE with 759m shares exchanging hands.The Fed’s Beige Book revealed a more upbeat outlook on the US economy following an improvement in economic activity in the Fed’s 12 districts.Crude for Feb delivery lost US$1.37, or 1.3%, to close at US$100.87/barrel after an increase in crude inventories.Gold for Feb delivery gained US$8.10, or 0.5%, to settle at U$1,639.60/ounce on news of record gold imports to China ahead of CNY. Mar silver was up 7.5 cents, or 0.3%, to end at US$29.89/ounce.- Kathy Lien, Director of Currency research for GFT, noted that with two central bank rate decisions and the U.S. retail sales report scheduled for release on Thursday, investors should brace for a busy trading day.It has been quiet for most of the week particularly in USD/JPY, but with U.S. consumer spending numbers scheduled for release, a bit more volatility may be unavoidable.The latest non-farm payrolls report show stronger job growth in the U.S. economy, but that only matters so far as how it can impact consumer spending which is why the retail sales report is so important.Interestingly enough, despite the improvement in the labor market, consumer spending is expected to rise only 0.3 percent, which is an extremely modest gain especially since the International Council of Shopping Centers reported a 4.5 percent annualized rise in store sales.The holiday shopping season was a strong one, thanks in large part to heavy discounting and longer hours – according to a spokesman for ICSC, “the last few weeks of December helped to lift full-month performance above our earlier expectation.”However a similar report on chain store sales from Johnson Redbook showed a 2.1 percent decline in spending in the first five weeks of December from November, which is of course at odds with the rosier results seen in the ICSC report and explains why there is both upside and downside risk to the report.",0.8015134930610657,0.1745271384716034,0.023959415033459663
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs March 8, 2012 US stocks rebounded and the Nikkei also started positive.OCBC Investment Research said:The strong rebound on Wall Street overnight and the positive Nikkei start (+1% currently) are likely to inspire the local bourse to a higher opening this morning.Investors are also likely to take heart in the fact that the STI was able to hold above the key 2900 support; although the index fell 0.5% yesterday, it was off the early intraday 2906 low.However, we still believe that any rebound is likely to be short-lived, given that the daily technical indicators are still pretty bearish.Hence failure to clear the congestion zone around 2945-2960 could be another signal to watch. The main hurdle remains at 3000.On the downside, 2900 is the first support, ahead of 2869 (38.2% retracement of rally from 2606 to 3031).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Traders seem to have taken their fingers off the panic button for the time being as improved US employment figures and a likely Greek debt swap boost risk sentiment.Nerves have been on edge since Monday when China revised downwards its GDP growth forecasts. These jitters were exacerbated by the Greeks as its debt swap with private bondholders looked like it might be derailed.Markets have been tumbling ever since with the STI dropping to its lowest level in more than one month. But the day ahead may hopefully snap the index’s losses with a more upbeat mood and slight rebound from US and European stocks.The US saw 216,000 workers added last month to payrolls according to ADP figures, which support the optimism expected on Friday from non-farm payrolls figures.Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6% at 12837. The S&P was 0.7% higher at 1353 and the NASDAQ advanced 0.9% to finish at 2936.Europe also reversed some of its recent losses with promising news that so far 40% of private bondholders of Greek debt have agreed to the write-down of their assets, including BNP, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland.Greece’s threats to default on any of its bondholders who didn’t sign up seem to have worked. The fact that banks and financial institutions may be reluctant to ever buy Greek government debt again can be worried about another day.RBS, on the other hand, reported (for 7 March 2012 trading):It was a nothing of a day until the Hilsenrath article came out, which revived hopes of QE3 and boosted QE related trades (commodities up, equities up, dollar down, etc). Until then, we were patiently waiting for the Greek PSI to conclude tomorrow, and for payrolls on Friday.Now we have another input into the conversation, for markets had reduced QE3 odds after Bernanke's testimony last week and are now boosting them back to some degree. Before the article was released we saw real money selling in 7s and other real money buying in 10s.After, flows picked up and we had leveraged selling in 5s and 10s, and real money selling of 7s. In TIPS, we saw fast money buying of 3s, real money buying of 4s, real money buying of 10s, and net better selling in 30s.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri March 2, 2012 There was recovery in US equity markets and the Nikkei started strong.IG Markets Singapore said:US equity markets recovered last night to lay some solid foundations for an end of week flourish for the STI.Stock markets quickly came out of their sulk over quantitative easing being snatched away to put in some good gains. Equities liked the fact that the US economy (lower jobless claims), Europe (falling Spanish and French borrowing costs) and China (improving PMI manufacturing data) are all showing signs of recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2% although not enough to break into the 13,000 zone, the S&P 500 advanced 0.6% while NASDAQ put on 0.7%.The STI and Asian bourses took their cue from US markets yesterday which had slumped on the back of dimming hopes for QE3. Asian traders hope the US will again provide the impetus for today’s session, but this time driving markets higher.Singapore stocks had hit breached the 3,000 level in yesterday’s trading, showing a bullish sentiment was still in play, only to slide back below for the rest of the session. A bout of end-of-month profit-taking could be to blame along with QE3 being factored out of the market.RBS meanwhile reported:The Treasury market opened up on its back foot after European debt auctions (Spain and France) went well and China's PMI hit a 5-month high.The pressure continued when ISDA said that there would be no triggering of payments on Greek CDS and then the 4-week moving average in jobless claims hit a new cycle low while early car sales came in above strong expectations. Credit rater Egan Jones later said that QE3 could trigger a US downgrade, or at least another ratings review from the company.Treasuries got a brief bounce off their lows when the personal income data was weaker than hoped for and ISM mfg. was also below heightened expectations. Even so, it was a risk on or, better yet, riskless-off for today's (March 1) session.Indeed, it felt like the market is still digesting yesterday's (February 29) big-block sales in TY futures. Treasuries traded quite poorly despite the fact that the ISM and the personal income data came in weaker than expected.OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, noted:The rebound on Wall Street overnight and the strong Nikkei start (+0.7% now) are likely to inspire the local bourse to an optimistic opening as well this morning.Over the past two sessions, the STI made attempts to overcome the 3000 psychological mark but failed to do so; despite opening 0.2% higher yesterday, the index slipped steadily for the rest of the day to close more than 0.5% in the red.But with today's sentiments likely to improve significantly, we could see the index rebounding back in the direction of the 3000 psychological resistance again. A convincing break above this immediate obstacle will send the index towards the subsequent resistance at the 3031 recent peak.On the downside, we still see the immediate base at the 2947 recent trough formed, followed by the subsequent support at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support region.",0.22354313731193542,0.7458062171936035,0.030650675296783447

Europe fared worse with the FTSE 100 falling 0.8% and Germany’s DAX giving up 1.3%.HSBC’s China PMI number came in at 48.1, well below the previous month’s 49.6 reading, and put pressure on Asian stocks. It was then the eurozone’s turn to print its weak manufacturing numbers which had the same effect across Europe, spilling over into the US.The growth concerns surrounding China and Europe overshadowed the stronger-than-expected unemployment claims number in the US, which would have otherwise given the markets a lift.  RBS meanwhile noted (for 22 March 2012 trading):Treasuries continued their rebound today on the back of very weak European PMI data and slightly increasing concerns regarding Chinese growth.Overall the moves in fixed income were more muted today compared to yesterday, but there was still good activity in the market. Amidst a lot of talk of pending asset allocation into month end (out of stocks and into bonds), we did see some real money buying of the long end which was supportive of this story.We also had macro buying in 10s, real money selling in 10s and mixed activity in 5s, and central bank selling in 3s.In swaps we had some 2s5s10s unwinds, and in TIPS, we saw better selling of 30s and off the run 10s before the auction, and afterwards we saw better buying of 10s.Treasury broker volume today was 81% of the 10-day average.OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, reported:Renewed weakness on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start (-1% now) could continue to weigh on local sentiment today; but downside could be limited as the STI has already seen a fairly sharp correction of 0.9% yesterday afternoon due to the sharply lower European markets' opening.Assuming the index can hold above the immediate 2960 support (recent minor trough), we could potentially see a technical rebound back towards 3000.Below 2960, the subsequent base lies at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed March 7, 2012 US and Europe suffered heavy losses overnight.OCBC Investment Research said:The sharp retreat on Wall Street is likely to weigh further on the local bourse this morning.The STI, which already fell by 2% yesterday, could retreat further to test the 2900 support; although it did managed to close above 2931 (23.6% retracement of rally from 2606 to 3031).And if 2900 gives way, the index could ease to around 2869 (38.2% retracement level).Besides the daily MACD still looking quite bearish, we note that both the RSI and stochastics suggest that the market is not yet oversold; hence bargain hunting may not be advisable yet. We now peg the initial cap at 2959 (30-day moving average) ahead of the key psychological 3000 level.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:It looks like the party is over for 2012’s early-year rally buoyed by cheap money and improving economic conditions. Asia led the bears into action yesterday while the US and Europe followed suit last night suffering heavy losses.The STI shed 2% yesterday and traders will be assuming the brace position today as another bumpy ride looks likely. The US saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.6% while the S&P 500 fell 1.5%, its biggest daily loss this year. Super Tuesday it was not.Worries over China’s growth prospects and fears of Greek’s bailout package not being taken up by private bondholders were too much to take for the markets which are today nursing severe hangovers.In Europe the FTSE 100 dropped 1.9% while the DAX plummeted 3.4%. Growth for the eurozone fell by 0.3% in Q4 2011 as it slips closer to recession, bringing down hopes of a global recovery with it.Ironically, one of the few markets to end up posting gains among a sea of red was the Greek stock market – the Athens stock exchange ended up 2.8%.Rumours that Greece may have to extend its deadline beyond Thursday to round up more investors are likely to keep nervous traders at bay this week. However, the last thing European leaders want is to bring uncertainty back into the markets so they are likely to push hard to meet the deadline.RBS, on the other hand, reported (for 6 March 2012 trading):Even with the strong rally in Treasuries, 10yr yields are closing at the mid-point of the 1.80-2.10% range (again).

The offer has attracted prominent anchor investors such as JF Asset Management, Prudential Asset Management, FIL Investment Management, VPL Funds and Kenrich Partners.Top three local grocery retailers. The group is Singapore’s third largest grocery retailer after NTUC Fairprice and Dairy Farm. To further expand its network, Sheng Siong recently announced that it had entered a lease agreement to secure premises for a new store in Woodlands Park. We understand the lease agreement is for a period of three years from 1 October 2011, with two consecutive options to renew for additional periods of three years each.Recession-proof business. Perhaps the biggest investment merit for Sheng Siong is that it is operating in a relatively stable business with strong cash flow generation amidst a potential economic slowdown. While the group has no formal policy, it intends to distribute up to 90% of its net profit to shareholders for the FY11/12. Appears fairly priced for now. Sheng Siong is trading at 19.7x core FY10 (fully diluted) PER but still a discount to its closest peer, Dairy Farm of about 24x. At current level, we estimate the stock offers a prospective dividend yield of almost 5%.",0.8655707836151123,0.008646631613373756,0.12578260898590088

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon Feb 6, 2012 The bourse is expected to start the week right following positive results from US stocks and the Nikkei.OCBC Investment Research said:With US stocks surging more than 1% higher on Friday night and the Nikkei having a similarly strong start (+1.2% now), these are likely to provide inspiration for the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI attempted again to overcome the 2916 key resistance in the last session (surged as much as 1.1%) but fell short of convincingly clearing it as it closed just 0.6% higher at 2917 by the end of the session.But with today's outlook likely to turn sharply upside biased, we could see the index gapping up at the open and overcome the immediate resistance at 2931 (Friday's intraday high) with relative ease, before heading towards the subsequent key obstacle the 3000 psychological resistance.On the downside, we still see the immediate support at around 2874 (recent minor trough), followed by the 2852-2860 gap support which is now the secondary base.Meanwhile GFT reported:Currencies and equities ended the week on a strong note thanks to the better than expected U.S. labor market report. All of the major currencies traded higher against the U.S. dollar on Friday with the exception of the Swiss Franc which came under pressure after SNB acting Chairman Jordan promised to defend the 1.20 EUR/CHF peg with “utmost determination.”",0.9327560067176819,0.04274286702275276,0.02450106106698513
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri Jan 20, 2012 What was described as a stellar start for the Nikkei Index and the continued Wall Street recovery mean good news for Singapore.OCBC Investment Research said:With Wall Street continuing its recovery overnight and the Nikkei Index having a stellar start (+1.5% at the moment), we could see the local bourse opening significantly higher this morning as well.As a recap, the STI rebounded from its 0.7% correction on Wednesday to end almost 0.6% higher yesterday; this suggesting that the investors are already feeling more optimistic about the market outlook.And with today's tone likely to remain upside biased, the index could climb further in the direction of the next key support-turned-resistance at 2910.Above 2910, we still see the subsequent obstacle at the 3000 key psychological level. On the downside, 2793 is still the immediate support, with the subsequent base pegged at 2735 (minor resistance-turned-support and 100-DMA).Meanwhile GFT noted:Risk appetite continues to improve with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising to its highest level in 5 months. The U.S. dollar lost value against the European currencies but gained strength against the Japanese Yen and the comm. dollars. According to this morning's U.S. economic reports, conditions in the labor market continue to improve. Weekly jobless claims fell to its lowest levels since April 2008 and as a survey period for the January non-farm payrolls report, it reflects a healthy improvement in the labor market.Weekly claims dropped to 352k from 402k while continuing claims fell to 3.432 million from 3.647 million. Federal Reserve officials will be relieved to see claims back off from the 400k mark and at bare minimum, we believe this week's jobless claims report points to payroll growth in excess of 150k.Although housing starts and building permits declined in December, the U.S. economy is moving in the right direction because the labor market needs to stabilize before housing can follow. Housing starts dropped 4.1 percent last month while building permits declined 0.1 percent. November was also a very strong month for both reports, so the latest decline could represent some payback.Inflation on the other hand is muted with consumer prices holding steady in December. Much of the decline had to do with lower gas prices because core CPI grew 0.1 percent. Manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region grew at a faster pace in January but the reading was lower than expected while the December number was revised downwards.The latest economic reports may not contain enough changes to affect Fed policy, but there is enough to make them feel less concerned about the labor market and more confident in their current monetary policy stance.",0.29181206226348877,0.6841920018196106,0.02399594523012638
"Global IPO activity falls to lowest level since Q2’09 Even as first quarter was the first time that just one deal raised above US$1b since Q1’09.Global IPO activity has fallen sharply in Q1 2012, according to Ernst & Young’s Global IPO update. So far this quarter, a total of 157 deals has raised only US$14.3b, down by 69% by capital raised (US$46.6b in 296 deals), compared to the same period last year. This is the lowest quarter on record since Q2 2009 when there were 82 IPOs worth US$10.4b.Globally, this quarter was the first time that just one deal raised above US$1b since Q1’09 when no IPOs exceeded US$1b. Average deal size decreased to US$91m compared to US$157m in Q1’11, a 42% drop. Seven IPOs have been postponed and 36 withdrawn in Q1 2012, compared to 5 and 53 respectively for Q1’11. In terms of pricing, 81% of global IPOs in the quarter priced within or above their initial filing range, while just 7% of IPOs were priced above their initial filling range1.Terence Ho, Greater China Strategic Growth Markets Leader at Ernst & Young comments: “Despite difficult current market conditions, there are a number of positive signs of fundraising activity worldwide. Companies are no longer simply listing on their national market by default. 2012 is already seeing more cross-border activity, with companies from all regions listing on exchanges like Hong Kong, London and the US.”A slower start of the year in Asian exchangesDespite a tough start of the year, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchange were yet again among the top five global markets ranked by capital raised. Out of the top 20 global IPOs this quarter, 8 were listed on Asian stock exchanges, and IPO activity in those markets accounted for 47% of global IPO funds raised in Q1’12, with 84 deals completed, raising US$6.7b. However, Asia experienced a 74% drop in capital raised, compared to Q1’11 (155 deals which raised US$25.9b). The largest Asian IPO in Q1 was the US$794m listing of China Communications Construction Co on Shanghai stock exchanges.Ho says: “Greater China remains an attractive destination to companies from the developed markets in the consumer products, industrial (e.g., infrastructure), materials (e.g., metals and mining) and technology sectors. In addition, as the Shanghai stock exchange fully opens to overseas investors in the near future, we will see an abundance of foreign companies listing in mainland China as well as Hong Kong.”US: technology companies to show the wayTechnology IPOs are continuing to drive the US IPO market. Of the 32 IPOs completed on U.S stock exchanges, which raised US$ 4.8b, 11 were technology IPOs, which raised US$1.1b or roughly 34% by number of deals, reflecting the US’ growing dependence on the products and services provided by technology companies. Ho continues: “The average market value for US technology companies at the time of their IPO was double the average market value, compared to companies from other sectors. Also, interesting to note that these companies tended to sell smaller percentages of their shares (typically 10%-15%); we expect to see other sectors looking into that IPO strategy in 2012.”Continued volatility in Europe in 2012In Q1’12, European stock exchanges raised US$2.5b in 24 IPOs (18% of global capital raised this quarter), due to hosting two of this quarter’s largest IPOs, of Dutch cable operator Ziggo, which listed on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam for US$1.1b and Swiss market expansion services group, DKSH Holding Ltd’s US$897m listing on Swiss Exchange. “The largest deal this quarter demonstrates that as we move further into 2012, there is a greater confidence in the capital market and the trend is slowly shifting towards companies floating a smaller percentage of their equity,” continues Ho.IPOs by sectorsBy funds raised, almost one in five IPOs was from the industrials sector (US$2.7b in 29 deals), followed by consumer products and services (US$2.2b in 16 deals). By deal numbers over one in five IPOs was from the technology sector (US$2.1b in 35 deals – 22%). “Technology IPOs remain very attractive to investors, who are actively looking for the right type of investment. In this environment, we expect to keep seeing big technology companies listing at home or abroad,” says Ho.",0.011732134036719799,0.9703183770179749,0.017949439585208893
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs March 22, 2012 Softer open for the STI is expected following muted reactions on Wall Street and the flat Nikkei start.IG Markets Singapore said:It was another sluggish night on Wall Street and across Europe as markets falter after their stellar start to the year and wonder where the next big push will come from.So far there only seems to be pulls on the horizons. Last night Fed chairman Ben Bernanke warned that higher energy prices will probably slow growth in the short term. This may have spooked traders as no-one has yet got handle on how far oil prices will continue to rise.Recent efforts to slow their trajectory haven’t lasted for long. After a big retreat from Saudi Arabia offering to increase production, they rebounded after lower-than-expected US crude inventories were revealed yesterday.They then dipped again after France said industrialized nations are considering the release of strategic crude stockpiles but made little impact on the futures market. WTI crude futures for April delivery still sit at a very toppy $106.89 a barrel while Brent futures are at $124.20.This volatile path could continue with traders panicking about who will release emergency sources of oil and where new supplies will come from, while world stockpiles continue to be tested.US markets were mostly weaker, as mixed data saw investors remain cautious. US existing home sales slightly missed consensus, though an upward revision to January offset some of the February disappointment. In Europe there are also renewed fears about Spain with spreads blowing out considerably this month, especially against Italy. Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4% at 13125. The S&P was 0.2% lower at 1403 and the NASDAQ rose a point to finish at 3075. Close to home another pull factor could be China, which is now targeting its monetary easing at rural areas of the country by cutting the required reserve ratio for branches of the Agricultural Bank of China.Investors have been putting China under scrutiny over worries about its slowdown but this latest move is a reminder of how it can push the monetary easing button when required. China will also be in the line of fire today with HSBC’s flash PMI manufacturing numbers out this morning. There is talk of the number coming in above 50 which would signify expansion and keep the hard-landing China bears from the door for a bit longer.This data is likely to set the tone for the rest of Asia today after no real clues from Wall Street. The STI’s 3,000 level looks likely to be tested again today although traders can take heart that while volumes are still low, the IPO market could be picking up with five potential foreign listings in the pipeline.But the futures market is pointing at a softer open for the STI this morning.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:The muted reactions on Wall Street overnight and the flat Nikkei start are unlikely to provide any cues to the local bourse this morning.The STI continued to consolidate within a fairly tight range yesterday. Following a flat opening, the index traded in a muted session for the rest of the session before closing just 0.1% higher.But with today's tone likely to largely remain unchanged, we could see the index hovering around current levels, capped by the 3030 immediate key resistance and the 2960 immediate support (recent minor trough).Meanwhile, the subsequent obstacle is still marked at 3065 (trough in Jul '11), with the subsequent base pegged at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.",0.013138378970324993,0.9668574333190918,0.020004183053970337
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues March 20, 2012 Bullish market sentiment in the US could help see the STI recover after dropping below 3,000.IG Markets Singapore said:The STI fell off the bull yesterday dropping below 3,000 but will get another chance today with more bullish market sentiment coming out of the US. Last night US stocks added to last week’s solid gains with Apple’s surprise announcement that it will be paying dividends and buying back shares. The stock is definitely the apple of traders’ eyes and shot up to $600. UPS’s planned takeover of TNT also added to the optimism that the US economy is stirring back into life.Add in data showing US home-builder sentiment has hit its highest level in almost five years and you can see why the bulls are gathering pace.But the local market still seems to be showing nervousness at jumping feet-first into the cool waters of this fresh economic optimism. Having lasted three days above 3,000 last week it finally capitulated in Monday’s trading despite a strong start as profit-taking and caution about China’s engineered slowdown took hold.While Europe is clearly not out of hospital yet, most observers believe the days in the accident and emergency ward are over for the time being. While a messy multi-country default looks less likely, the number one concern is now oil.Meanwhile GFT noted (for 19 March 2012 trading):In a perfect world, currencies, equities and bonds will move in unison, telling the same story about the market’s outlook for the U.S. economy. Today U.S. equities rose to its highest level in more than 3 years while the 10 year bond yield climbed to its highest in 4 months and yet the dollar weakened.This inconsistent performance in the greenback confirms that the currency has become extremely overbought and indicates that investors need more than a slight push higher in U.S. equities to continue to buy dollars at these lofty levels.With no major U.S. economic data on the calendar, the rise in stocks was fueled largely by the market’s enthusiasm about Apple, who announced its first ever quarterly dividend and stock buyback program. The NAHB housing market index which measures builders’ sentiment held steady at 28 in March and holding near its 5 year high reflects more strength than weakness in the U.S. housing market.However what everyone has ignored is the rise in oil. WTI Crude traded above $108 a barrel, driving the average price for a gallon of gasoline higher for the 10th consecutive trading day. Although the average price is still 6.6 percent below the record high, every penny that gas prices go up is a penny less a car driving American has to spend on discretionary goods.In more significant terms, each 50 cent increase in the average price per gallon adds approximately $600 billion to annual consumer bills. The rise in stocks and the rise in yields lead many to wonder if investors are ignoring rising oil prices at their own peril. OCBC Invetsment Research, on the other hand, reported:The mostly muted reactions on Wall Street overnight and the flat Nikkei start (+0.1% now) are likely to cue the local bourse to a similar opening as well this morning.Despite the early push to retest the 3030 resistance yesterday with a 0.6% higher opening, the STI gave up all its gains to end the day nearly 0.7% in the red.And with today's tone unlikely to show any significant improvement, we could possibly see the index consolidating around current levels with 3030 firmly marked as the immediate key obstacle to overcome in the near term.Beyond that, the subsequent resistance is pegged at 3065 (minor trough in Jul '11). On the downside, 2900 (key resistance-turned-support) is still the vital base for the index, with the subsequent support seen at 2875 (minor trough in Jan '12).",0.8867706060409546,0.08192086964845657,0.03130853548645973

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed March 28, 2012 The STI faces strong downward pressure after moving back into the 3,000 zone, while the futures market points to a weaker opening.IG Markets Singapore said:The Bernanke Bounce didn’t last for long as US equity markets retreated from their highs last night. While the bounce pushed Asian equities much higher yesterday there are fears the bears will be out in force to lead a pullback, repeating last night’s activity on Wall Street.Despite some early ebullience brought about by fund managers buying top-performing stocks (aka end-of-quarter window dressing) Wall Street ended the session lower.Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3% at 13198. The S&P was 0.3% lower at 1413 and the NASDAQ shed 0.1% to finish at 3120. But as the quarter comes to a close the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12% this year and few would have argued with those returns at the end of 2011.Bernanke’s comments about possible quantitative easing have created ambiguous feelings among traders. First there was early euphoria that cheap dollars would once again flood the market and prop up risk assets. But now the dust has settled it highlights that all may not be as rosy in the garden of US economic recovery as first thought.Last night, investors digested softer US home prices and consumer confidence data which had fingers hovering over the “risk off” button. As risk appetite fell, the US dollar gained ground against most of the majors, while equities and commodities slipped. Yesterday’s standout performance came from Japan as the Nikkei 225 rocketed 2.4% erasing the losses suffered since last year’s earthquake. Japan’s index has been well supported by a weaker yen over the past few months and has outperformed the region. However, today could be a different story with more than 200 Japanese companies going ex-dividend today. OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:Weaker Wall Street overnight and a poor Nikkei start (down 1%) are likely to see the STI opening lower on profit-taking this morning, especially after the index surged 1.5% higher yesterday.Again, the key 3000 level will be tested – this time as a support; and if it should fail to hold, the STI could ease further towards 2950-2960 region.On the upside, we continue to see 3031-3035 as the immediate hurdle, ahead of 3041 (upper Bollinger band).While the tone has turned slightly more positive recently, the market does not appear to be convinced that the recent rebound was anything but technical. We note that the index has also covered a significant gap (3026-3105) and is thus looking slightly jaded.",0.017836930230259895,0.9629940986633301,0.019168918952345848
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs March 15, 2012 There was mixed and muted reaction on Wall Street while China bore some bad news.IG Markets Singapore said:Cometh the STI breaching 3,000, cometh the pullback from nervous profit-taking. The bulls will be hoping this slightly-adapted quotation doesn’t ring true today as the STI starts the day having broken the 3,000 psychological barrier again this year.Swept on a wave of economic optimism, albeit being generated solely from the US, not even more dampening news from China could stop the STI putting on 1.3% yesterday. But today traders will have digested Chinese premier Wen’s negative comments about the property market which he says is still priced too high, delaying any easing of curbs on buyers. Yesterday it led to a big slump on the Shanghai Composite pushing it down 2.6%. And last night this negative sentiment found its way into US markets which had a subdued night as a result. Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1% at 13194. The S&P was down two points at 1394 and the NASDAQ added a point to finish at 3041.Talk is growing of China now showing signs of a hard landing, with so much data now coming out revealing cracks in the soft landing argument. A stubbornly-high property market, ballooning imports, shrinking exports and a downward revision of GDP growth all announced in the last few days have the hard-landing camp rubbing their hands with glee.Meanwhile OCBC Investment Research noted:The mixed and muted reaction on Wall Street overnight is unlikely to provide much inspiration to the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI displayed some great positive signs yesterday with a bullish break out of its 1-month consolidations pattern; following a 0.8% higher opening, the index climbed steadily to a 1.3% gain by the close.But with the market likely to see a technical correction today after yesterday's strong display, we could see the index consolidating around current levels with the initial support marked at the 3000 key psychological level.Beyond that, we see the subsequent support at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri Feb 3, 2012 Expect neutral opening today following mixed results on Wall Street and a not-so-good Nikkei start.OCBC Investment Research said:With US stocks closing mixed overnight and the Nikkei having a mildly negative start (-0.2% now), these are likely to cue the local bourse to a fairly neutral opening as well this morning.As a recap, the STI attempted another bullish break at the 2916 key resistance yesterday but fell short of that goal by the close. Despite gapping up 0.5% at the open, the index slipped and ended the day 0.1% in the red instead.And with today's outlook likely to remain more consolidative in nature, we could see the index continue to swing fairly narrowly between the 2916 key resistance and the minor support around 2874 (recent minor trough).Above the 2916 key obstacle, we still see the subsequent resistance at the 3000 psychological level. On the downside, the 2852-2860 gap support is now the secondary base.RBS meanwhile noted:A quiet day with little movement in US equities contributed to a quiet session among the G10 currencies as price action was relatively subdued ahead of the US labour data release. The USD made modest gains but for the most part the G10 USD pairs were rangebound for most of the session.EUR/USD dropped early in the New York session as the unresolved issue of Greek private sector involvement persisted but the pair recovered later to remain relatively unchanged around 1.3140. USD/JPY moved slightly higher while GBP/USD edged lower to the 1.58 area.GFT, on the other hand, reported:There have been no new developments out of Europe over the past 24 hours and for this reason, the euro continued to consolidate against the U.S. dollar. The only piece of economic data out of the Eurozone was producer prices which fell 0.2 percent in the month of December.Inflationary pressures have been falling across the globe and so it is not a surprise to see producer prices in Europe ease. Central banks around the world, the ECB included believe that prices will hold steady and possibly decline further this year as demand continues to slow.Discussions between Greece and the IIF are moving forward and according to the IIF, who represents private bond holders, a deal is imminent. Portugal’s 10 year bond yields have declined further to 13.75 percent but Greek bonds yields have moved up by 22bp.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon March 19, 2012 The STI pushed through the 3,000 mark, and traders are seemingly more bullish.IG Markets Singapore said:It seems traders are becoming more bullish with every week that passes. With a total eurozone meltdown in the rearview mirror and a US economic recovery gaining traction there is plenty to be positive about. And the bulls seem to be on top right now with Wall Street hitting heights it hasn’t seen since before the Global Financial Crisis. Last week the S&P 500 broke through the 1,400 mark, its highest level for almost four years.Meanwhile, the STI pushed through the 3,000 mark and still sits there as we start a new week, despite some niggling doubts about how hard China’s landing will eventually be.Traders are now talking about a breakout which could see the STI hit 3,200 within the next few months as investor confidence goes up a notch. With the finger clearly on a green button marked “risk on” it seems the good times are rolling.But the bears are still worried that we are jumping the gun on a recovery, focusing on the good news while ignoring the deep concerns within the world economy that haven’t just disappeared this year. Huge eurozone government debts, a US economy still vulnerable despite continued signs of recovery, China’s shaky slowdown, a reliance on cheap central bank funding, rising oil prices and sticky inflation all spring to mind.RBS, on the other hand, reported (for 16 March 2012 trading):Today's moves were encouraging but do not quite signal an all clear for the long end. Anecdotally there continues to be an impression of money waiting to go into yield (Treasuries, MBS, and credit), if only we can have some stabilization ahead of key support levels such at 2.40% in 10yrs.A notable positive is that the market showed an ability to withstand another trip towards support, closing well off the lows. On the flip side, we still closed higher in yield on a close-to-close basis, showing that buyers are willing to step in at higher yields but right now are in no rush to pay up for securities.We examine this and other dynamics more closely in our weekly, but to sum it up we feel 2s and 3s appear to be holding and we think money will be comfortable investing there, but while the rallies off support the last two sessions have been encouraging, the jury is still out on the long end.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:Although the US market closed mixed and muted last Friday night, the positive Nikkei start (+0.3%) and the higher US index futures (+0.2%) is likely to cue the local bourse to a more optimistic opening this morning.The STI ended 0.5% in the red last Friday, despite making a brief spike above the 3030 resistance to hit an intraday high of 3035.But with today's tone likely to turn more upside biased, we could possibly see the index making another test of the 3030 (key peak in Feb '12) resistance again. A bullish break above this level could see it climbing towards the 3055 support-turned-resistance.On the downside, 3000 psychological level is still the immediate support for now, with the subsequent base pegged at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.",0.9289233684539795,0.027763713151216507,0.043312907218933105
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri Jan 27, 2012 Friday bears not so good news for the local bourse following setback in US stocks.OCBC Investment Research said:US stocks slipped overnight and this is likely to weigh further on local sentiments this morning after the STI showed signs of halting its strong climb yesterday.Despite surging as much as 0.9% intraday, the index faced a fairly strong selling pressure at around the 2910 key resistance before pulling back to just a 0.1% gain by the close.And with today's tone likely to remain more downside biased, we could see the index falling further towards the immediate support at the 2852-2860 (gap support formed recently).Below that, the subsequent base is at the 2793 resistance-turned-support. On the upside, we still see the vital resistance around 2910 (key support-turned-resistance and 200-DMA), with the subsequent obstacle pegged at the 3000 key psychological level.RBS, on the other hand, noted:The USD strengthened modestly during the session versus the EUR and some of the higher-beta G10 currencies, such as the AUD, NZD and CAD, as equities closed the session lower. But despite some of the retracement today, the USD was still weaker across the board following Wednesday's FOMC decision as relative rate differentials remained unfavourable to the USD.USD/JPY remained below 77.60 for much of the session as the reaction to the Fed's end-2014 projection for its policy rate dampened some of the recent upside momentum in the pair. USD/CAD briefly broke below parity and we continue to hold long CAD vs. short USD and JPY recommendations.Meanwhile GFT said:The EUR/USD continued to power higher, rising 7 out of the past 8 trading days. Stronger German consumer confidence contributed to the rally by easing concerns about a recession in the Eurozone this year. Low unemployment helped to boost sentiment for the fifth month in a row and according to GfK, the agency that conducts the survey, morale in Germany should increase further in the month of February.This upbeat outlook is not unique to consumers – earlier this month we saw similar reports of stronger investor and business sentiment. These reports show that confidence is not completely lost in the Eurozone even if it means that Germany decouples from the rest of the region. As the largest economy in the Eurozone, they control the purse strings. They are forcing austerity on other Eurozone nations while enjoying for themselves the benefit of a weaker euro.The EUR/USD continues to shake off all EUR negative news including the sharp rise in Portuguese bond yields and reports that the ECB is split on how to handle their holdings of Greek debt. European Union leaders continue to look to the IIF and Greece to solve their own problems – they announced today that there will be no plans to hold a special meeting on Greece at the EU Summit.There was also talk that a Greek deal could be close to a deal with creditors ready to accept a lower coupon payment. Given how many times these “rumors” about Greece end up unsubstantiated, we remain skeptical about the accuracy. In the meantime the EUR/USD has cleared its 50-day SMA but has yet to break above 1.32, which is the key level mentioned yesterday. As a former breakdown and support turned resistance point, this is a critical level for the EUR/USD to break before further gains are possible.",0.8718849420547485,0.10898657888174057,0.01912848651409149
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Feb 16, 2012 Treasury yields generally fell amidst shaky risk assets.GFT noted:The euro fell sharply against the U.S. dollar today on the fear that Europe will allow Greece to default. Even though Eurogroup President Juncker released a statement after today’s conference call saying that substantial progress has been made, investors have grown tired of false promises.There has been very little demand for euros because investors want Euro area Finance Ministers to release an explicit commitment on releasing bailout funds for Greece before they are willing to buy euros.Although Juncker said he is confident that decisions will be made on February 20th, the problem of getting short changed too often is that you start to become immune to signs of progress. You can’t blame them however, especially when Greek government officials were quick to respond with critical and confusing comments.According to Greek Finance Minister Venizelos, Greece “has met the majority of the terms” they have been asked for “in return for the (first) financing package, unfortunately we are continually faced with new terms.”Greek President Papoulias isn’t playing nice either – he expressed his anger over the “insults” and “ridicule” by the Germans, Dutch and Finns publicly in a not so polite manner. Juncker believes that a deal is close but we have been there before and promises no longer suffice.With this in mind, February 20th is not very far away. If the Euro area Finance Ministers manage to get their act together on Monday and make a decision on a second bailout for Greece, traders waiting on sidelines could jump back in quickly to bid the EUR/USD higher. Both the Eurozone and Greece have a lot to lose from a default and hopefully they understand the risks and will avoid it at all costs. RBS, on the other hand, reported:It is getting difficult to keep up with the ins-and-outs of developments in relation to Greece, delays and bridge loans and how each may or may not impact the PSI negotiations. Needless to say, the situation is making investors uncomfortable.We recently thought that we could buy more time as we head to the February 29th LTRO allocation, but this isn't helpful and raises the prospect that the end game for the latest Greek aid package will being drawn out further in time.So despite mixed but generally decent domestic data (2nd tier mind you), Treasury yields generally fell amid shaky risk assets. The exception to this was the 30yr, which felt pressure ahead of tomorrow's 30yr TIPS auction. We saw central bank buying of 3s, macro selling of 3s, leveraged selling in 10s, and domestic real money buying in 10s. Total Treasury broker volume today was 116% of the 10-day average.",0.02152245119214058,0.94621741771698,0.0322602204978466
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues March 6, 2012 There’s bad news from overseas amidst weakness on Wall Street and a not-so-good Nikkei start.OCBC Investment Research said:Renewed weakness on Wall Street and a muted Nikkei start are likely to weigh further on the local bourse this morning.The STI, which slipped 0.1% yesterday, while off intraday 2983 low, could continue to ease towards 2950 (30-day moving average); but we expect 2931 (23.6% retracement of rally from 2606 to 3031) to hold.As before, daily technical indicators have been looking mildly negative for a while – the MACD has been negative since 21 Feb and that was when the index hit the YTD high of 3031.We continue to peg 3000 as the initial cap, ahead of 3011 (where the STI could trigger a bullish parabolic buy signal).IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:THE STI will hope to bounce back from China’s lower GDP thunderbolt yesterday, after a welcome boost from the manufacturing sector.PMI figures released last night show that manufacturing expanded for the first time in seven months - a positive sign that the economy is turning the corner. While the economy is not out of the operating theatre yet it is still showing good signs of recovery.The local market may also be buoyed by better-than-expected economic data out of the US which shows its all-important services industry is also expanding. The services industry makes up a staggering 90% of the US economy. Although another step in the right direction it did little to spark life into equity markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat, the S&P dropped 0.3% while NASDAQ fell 0.4%.It seems traders were more concerned with the negative noise coming out of China as it lowers its growth estimates for the year ahead, rather than a strengthening US economy. While the economic balance of power still sits with the US for the time being, China’s growth engine can still rock the boat when it starts to splutter.Asian markets will have plenty of overnight data to digest in today’s trading session along with assessing the headline risks that are looming on the horizon. RBS, on the other hand, reported (for 5 March 2012 trading):Treasuries put in a quiet session and a 4bp range despite decent moves in equities and other risk assets.""Growth"" trades were put on notice overnight when China downgraded their annual growth target for the first time since 2005, from 8% to 7.5%. For example, copper and aluminum fell approximately -1% today, and global equity exchanges posted similarly modest pullbacks.Our NY flows were modest, with some macro buying of 10s, domestic selling in 10s, and central bank buying in 3s. The day was truly dominated by the corporate bond market, where ~$16bn in IG and ~$4bn in HY deals were priced.To put this in perspective, all of February saw ~$131bn in IG bonds priced. A healthy issuance day indeed! Total Treasury broker volume today was 84% of the 10-day average.",0.2010062336921692,0.7732357978820801,0.025757912546396255
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed Feb 29, 2012 Nikkei started strong and US markets closed higher overnight.IG Markets Singapore said:The STI will be hoping traders focus on the bigger global picture if it is to continue its winning ways today as positive economic news from the US and Europe improve risk sentiment.After moving back up to 2969.7 yesterday, the psychological 3,000 level is back in sight for the bulls hoping the more upbeat mood can be sustained. But events closer to home will make it a challenging day.Overnight US markets advanced on high hopes of a strong take-up in the ECB’s three-year LTRO which will hit the market in Europe today. However, the US economy gave out mixed messages yesterday with strong consumer confidence numbers but weak durable goods orders.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has had the 13,000 level in sight for most of 2012 and finally broke through it last night, as investor confidence continues to rise.Stocks were also helped along by the easing of oil prices which slipped almost 2%. WTI Crude for April delivery is now at $106.55 a barrel while Brent Crude has eased to $121.55.Weaker U.S durable goods numbers and an expected knock-on effect on demand helped push the price of oil down, while US inventories are believed to have risen, providing a much-needed cushion for future oil shocks.There was also some froth taken off the market as the price of oil has shot up this month over fears of falling supplies from Iran. This retreat could continue if geopolitical tensions don’t escalate anytime soon.Thankfully, the oil seems to be still flowing, despite the negative noise and heightened fears over future supplies.New highs for US equities, cheap European loans and stabilising oil prices are all good news for Asian markets which would welcome a spark into life this week.The problem for Singapore is that so many of its biggest stocks continue to post disappointing earnings figures, leaving big questions for traders as to the real health of the economy. This morning, commodity stock Noble has posted a 57% fall in Q4 net profits while City Developments saw its Q4 profits slump 32% due to lower rental incomes. More worrying signs that corporates are struggling with the strong economic headwinds blowing in from the West.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:With US stocks closing higher overnight and the Nikkei having a strong start (+0.7% now), these could inspire the local bourse to further recovery this morning.Following the relatively sharp decline on Monday, the STI initiated a technical rebound yesterday with a 0.2% higher opening before climbing for the rest of the session to a 0.8% gain by the close.With today's tone likely to remain more upside biased, we could see the index heading further north in the direction of the 2988-2996 gap resistance, with the subsequent obstacle lying at the 3031 recent peak.On the downside, we see the immediate base at around the 2932-2940 gap support, followed by the subsequent support at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support region.RBS, on the other hand, reported:Treasuries had a choppy day, gyrating back and forth along with risk assets. At first, soft Durables sparked a Treasury rally until near 10:00, when better consumer confidence and a risk asset rally turned the market around and yields headed back to unchanged (10yr yields were 2.5bps lower earlier).It felt like European markets wanted one last bullish push before they closed with the LTRO results tomorrow (Wednesday). In the US afternoon, markets settled into a quieter range trade, closing generally unchanged on the day.We saw leveraged selling in 10s, central bank selling of 10s, and real money selling in 30s. swaps flows were light, and in TIPS we saw better buying (breakevens mostly) with most of the flow in the back end. Front end was two-way. Total Treasury broker volume today (Tuesday) was 104% of the 10-day average.",0.14603844285011292,0.8351948857307434,0.018766717985272408
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues April 3, 2012 The STI started the quarter well on Monday holding above 3,000 following the release of China’s manufacturing data.OCBC Investment Research said:The continued recovery by US stocks overnight is likely to cue the local bourse to a positive opening this morning although the negative Nikkei start (-0.4% now) could limit the gains.As a recap, the STI continued to trend higher just above its 6-month uptrend support yesterday; following a 0.1% higher opening, the index inched higher to a 0.2% gain by the close.And with today's tone likely to remain a tad more optimistic, we could see the index treading higher in the direction of the 3030 vital resistance, with the subsequent obstacle pegged at the 3075 support-turned-resistance.On the downside, we still see the immediate base at 2975 (recent trough), followed by the next support the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Wall Street kicked off the second quarter with a strong performance after US manufacturing data picked up more than expected last night.The ISM manufacturing index increased to 53.4 for March while factory employment rose to its highest level since June sending equities and commodities higher.Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4% at 13264, its highest level since December 2007.The S&P 500 was 0.8% higher at 1419, which sent it back to its near four-year high. The benchmark index is only 10% off its record high from October 2007 which is now looking a realistic target for US bulls.But Eurozone manufacturing numbers were weaker highlighting its growing divergence with the US economy. While one economy seems to recovering the other is flirting with recession.However European stock markets were in a buoyant mood. The DAX was up 1.6%, the CAC 40 rose 1.1% while the FTSE 100 soared 1.9% with UK manufacturing coming in better than expected.China stock markets are currently closed for a holiday until Thursday when the world’s second biggest economy will have a chance to digest its own upbeat factory output figures along with those of the US.While many traders were happy to partake in an optimistic start to the second quarter, many decided to sit on the side lines with such a data-heavy week ahead.Fed minutes will be released tonight while Wednesday and Thursday sees ECB and Bank of England interest rate decisions. But the big economic event of the week will be non-farm payrolls data out on Friday. But with this coinciding with Good Friday, most big markets will be closed which may dampen any bullish sentiment when they reopen.The STI started the quarter well yesterday holding above 3,000 as it gained from China’s manufacturing data, which is still being scrutinised given HSBC’s rival survey saw contraction for the fifth straight month.On the local market, a stock on the trader radar is Sembcorp Marine which has signed another multi-million dollar deal. The world’s second biggest rig builder has seen its share price rise 37% in quarter one, outperforming its rival Keppel Corp.Also in the spotlight are DBS shares which will trade again this morning after being suspended yesterday during its Danamon bid announcement.Despite the bullish Wall Street session last night, the futures market is pointing at a softer open for the STI this morning.",0.9040549993515015,0.07523039728403091,0.020714549347758293

And with today's tone likely to remain slightly more upside biased, we could see the index inching higher in the direction of the 3000 key psychological resistance, with the subsequent obstacle pegged at the 3070 support-turned-resistance. On the downside, we still see the immediate base at the 2931-2939 gap support, followed by the next support at 2874 (recent trough).Meanwhile RBS noted:With no data releases during US hours the week started off fairly quiet. EUR/USD failed to hold onto its overnight gains despite US equities pushing higher into the US close.With the Greek austerity package voted through parliament, focus shifts squarely on the Eurogroup meeting on Wednesday and one source said the EU would decide on the Greek package ""as a whole"" at the 15 February meeting, which may include a PSI deal.Elsewhere, USD/JPY was rangebound and closed the day essentially unchanged. EUR/JPY may struggle to hold onto recent gains as rate support appears to be lacking.GFT, on the other hand, reported:The Japanese yen weakened against the commodity currencies but remained relatively unchanged against the U.S. dollar, euro, and Swiss Franc. Economic data released over the weekend showed that Japan’s economy shrank more than expected.Preliminary gross domestic product contracted 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 as the global economic slowdown, Thai floods and a strong yen dealt a blow to the economy just as it was emerging from a recession brought on by last March’s devastating earthquake.Japan’s economy shrank an annualized 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, more than the expected 1.3 percent. Yesterday’s report increases pressure on Bank of Japan officials meeting today and tomorrow to consider more monetary easing as gains in the yen continue to magnify losses for companies from Sony to Panasonic to Nissan.Starting in 2012, Japan still faces two major headwinds; the continued strength of the yen and the contagion from the European debt crisis.",0.07423362135887146,0.912133514881134,0.013632886111736298

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues Feb 28, 2012 US markets closed flat and the Nikkei started weak.IG Markets Singapore said:We are likely to see the STI open in positive territory this morning, as US markets once again shrugged off early negative leads from Europe to finish the day well off their lows and back towards important levels for the market.Having watched the STI break through the key psychological 3000 level but fail to hold above it, local traders may now find encouragement from the fact that the Dow and the S&P once again moved back toward levels that mean we are close to 4-year highs on those US benchmarks.The Dow once again flirted with levels above 13,000 but did not manage to hold them into the close, edging back to finish the session flat. The S&P traded through the key level of 1370 but was also unable to sustain this by the closing bell. Both the S&P and Nasdaq did manage to close in positive territory. Well, marginally positive territory at least.Early US trading was marred, as was the trading day in Asia and Europe, by the uncertainty surrounding the European debt saga and the apparent lack of support from the G20 for the beleaguered region. We are still a long way from the bottom of European debt issues and continued concerns over individual nations and the region as a whole. Consequently, it is likely volatility will remain in financial markets as the story continues to unfold.OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, noted:The local bourse could continue to languish around current levels or even head lower after failing to hold above the key 2957 support yesterday; it closed 1% lower at 2946.78.The weaker Nikkei start (down 0.5% after opening 0.7%) lower and the flat Wall Street close are unlikely to provide much inspiration as well.Daily technical indicators continue to remain mixed to slightly more bearish, suggesting that the index may revisit 2900; although it should hold above 2869 (38.2% retracement of recent rally from 2606 to 3031).On the upside, 2966 (centre of Bollinger band) will be the initial cap, ahead of the key 3000 hurdle.GFT meanwhile reported:Based on the recovery in U.S. equities and the rally in other currencies, investors were clearly pleased to see German lawmakers approve a second bailout for Greece.The motion passed easily with 496 of the 591 members of the Bundestag lower house present in the chamber voting in favor of supplying Greece with a new EUR130 billion bailout package. To not do so would be “irresponsible” according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Although Germany’s contribution to the bailout has yet to be determined, they can expect to assume a large part of the costs.The German Parliamentary vote was one of the major event risks for the euro this week and with this hurdle cleared so easily, the euro should be trading much higher.

Above 3000, the next cap is likely at 3037 (top Bollinger band), ahead of 3138-3172 (gap).On the downside, we peg the initial support at the 2950 recent minor trough, with the next likely at 2910-2916 region.Meanwhile GFT noted:U.S. stocks traded sharply higher today on the renewed hope that Greece will avoid default. This is an evolving situation that changes day by day and today, investors have chosen to buy into the speculation.Amidst all of the uncertainty about Greece, U.S. economic data continues to surprise to the upside (at least the important reports). Weekly jobless claims dropped to 348k from 361k, the fewest since March 2008. This is the first time that we have seen claims fall below 350k in nearly 4 years and the significance has not been lost on investors.The Philadelphia Fed index also rose to a four month high of 10.2 from 9.0, a sign that the manufacturing sector continues to fuel the U.S. recovery.RBS, on the other hand, reported:Markets continue to be subject to the ping-pong back and forth of Greek headlines, and today's end result of all the news was favorable for risk assets, especially the signal that European central banks (ECB included) are getting involved in some manner with the debt swap.One can almost see the ministers come out of yesterday's meetings, look at their market screens, and wake up the next day seeing the need for some positive news (and with their Reuters or Dow Jones contacts cued up on speed dial).In any case, the feeling of progress for Greece is back, and the combination of better European news and ongoing good US data (claims in particular) had Treasuries on the defensive and US equities on the rise. A 7bps tail on the 30yr TIPS auction didn't particularly help Treasury market sentiment in the afternoon either, so Treasuries were weak just about all the way to the close.As for Greece, one can only hope that come Monday, all these leaked promises are fulfilled.",0.8426307439804077,0.11859774589538574,0.03877157345414162
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon Feb 20, 2012 US equities are said to be in buoyant mood, and everyone awaits the results of the EU ministers’ meeting today.Justin Harper, IG Markets Singapore head of research, said:Singapore could be in for a bright start to the week with a Greek bailout agreement looking like it may happen later today, a relaxation of China’s monetary policy and US equities in buoyant mood.Mondays have recently been filled with dread over what developments have taken place in Europe over the weekend, or haven’t in the case of Greece. But there seems to be an air of optimism ahead of the EU ministers’ meeting today to agree the release of much-needed funds. Greece has been helping to oil the wheels by approving further budget cuts of 325m euros including cutbacks to pensions and health care.Asian markets could also get a lift from the surprise announcement from the PBOC that it has cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) for its banks by 0.5 of a percentage point, which while sounding minor, could release 400 billion Yuan into the economy in fresh lending.With the ECB offering more cheap loans to eurozone banks a flood of cheap money is expected to slosh into the global economy from Europe and China rising the tide of risk. The markets are already starting to see a heightened risk-on sentiment returning to India, South Korea and Taiwan.The STI broke through the 3,000 last week and managed to end the week staying just above this important level. This week could see the STI use this as a decent springboard to put some more points on the board with the positive outlook being felt across the region as the week starts.Of course we are not without clouds on an albeit sunnier horizon. Companies are picking through the details of Friday’s Budget and calculating how it will affect them. Already there are grumbles of higher labour costs and the stoking of inflation, due to the impending foreign worker curbs.There will be no direction from US markets tonight as the country is celebrating President’s Day today. But based on its Friday session, the US is also enjoying an upturn in risk sentiment, with a strengthening economy as its catalyst.GFT, on the other hand, noted:This past week’s developments are a perfect example of the challenge that the Greek situation poses for countries across the Eurozone, the European Central Bank, rating agencies, and investors around the world. To say that it is complicated is an understatement.On Thursday, investors became very excited when various news sources reported that the ECB was prepared to swap its existing Greek bonds for new ones. As one of the major obstacles to the restructuring of Greek debt, this sign of progress was received warmly.Many European officials say they plan to approve a second bailout for Greece in days with some adding specifically that a decision will be at Monday’s Eurogroup meeting. Unfortunately there is still fear that the ECB’s Greek bond swap deal could trigger a default designation by rating agencies if the central bank ends up selling their bonds at their original purchase price, which would be lower than its face value.So far the ECB has yet to confirm the structure of their bond swap deal even though Eurozone officials have said that the swap has been completed.Another way a credit event (read – default) could be triggered would be if the Greek Parliament passes legislation that activates the Collective Action Clause (CAC), forcing all bond holders to agree to debt restructuring. This is not only possible but probable considering that the Greeks have already decided that this is legal because the chance of them convincing 100 percent of bond holders to agree to any Private Sector deal is slim. Meanwhile RBS reported:Flows were generally light today (Friday) as there were no great surprises in the CPI and leading indicators data. S&P futures had another good day and crept closer to 3-year highs. As always, the headlines out of Europe kept everyone in rapt attention and mostly sitting on hands pending Monday's purported meetings and agreements.We had hedge fund selling and real$ buying in 10's along with another real$ buyer in 30yrs.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tue Jan 17, 2012 Positive start in Japan trading could bring good news to Singapore.OCBC Investment Research said:With Wall Street closed for public holiday overnight, the positive Nikkei start (+0.5%) could provide a positive influence on the local bourse this morning.As a recap, the STI slipped to a 1.3% loss yesterday following a 0.7% lower opening; this likely a technical correction as the index has rallied very strongly in the past week.For now, 2735 (minor resistance-turned-support and 100-DMA) remains a fairly strong immediate support for the index in the event of further decline in the days ahead.Below that, we still see the subsequent support at 2683 (minor resistance-turned-support).

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon Feb 13, 2012 Wall Street retreats 0.7% but there's positivity with the US index futures.OCBC Investment Research said:The 0.7% retreat on Wall Street last Friday night could cue the local bourse to a poorer start this morning but the stronger US index futures (+0.4% now) and Nikkei 255 index (+0.4% now) could mitigate the downside pressure.Meanwhile, the STI is already showing signs that the market is toppish. Besides failing to test the 3000 key psychological resistance on Friday, the index slipped to a 0.7% loss and formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern.And with today's tone likely to remain slightly more cautious, we could see the index pulling back in the direction of the immediate gap support at 2931-2939.We see the subsequent support at 2874 (recent trough).

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed Feb 15, 2012 US stocks closed unchanged but the Nikkei started strong.OCBC Investment Research said:Although US stocks closed flat overnight, the strong Nikkei start (+1% now) could keep local sentiments fairly buoyant this morning.As a recap, the STI continued to consolidate just under the 3000 key psychological resistance yesterday; following a flat opening, the index edged higher to a 0.4% gain by the close. And with today's tone likely to remain slightly more upside biased, we could see the index inching higher towards the 3000 key psychological resistance, with the subsequent obstacle pegged at the 3070 support-turned-resistance. On the downside, we still see the immediate base at the 2931-2939 gap support, followed by the next support at 2874 (recent trough).Meanwhile GFT noted:As the problems in Europe persists, the rally in the EUR/USD continued to fizzle with the currency pair falling to a low of 1.3080 intraday.In the beginning of the week, Greek Prime Minister Papademos could almost taste victory after securing enough votes to win Parliamentary approval for further budget cuts. Unfortunately he was short on details and has failed to secure the blessing of Eurozone finance ministers, a crucial step in unlocking bailout funds. If the Eurogroup refuses to sign off on the deal, no money will be disbursed, forcing Greece to default.The region’s finance ministers were scheduled to hold an in person meeting on Wednesday to discuss and hopefully approve a second bailout for Greece but the lack of sufficient paperwork has led to their decision to forgo an in person meeting and to conduct a conference call instead.With their usual Eurogroup meeting scheduled for February 20th, the goal of the emergency meeting tomorrow was to hash out all of the details so that they could put the finishing touches on Monday. Now that the meeting has been demoted to a conference call, we don’t expect any progress or a decision on releasing bailout funds to be made in the next week.  RBS, on the other hand, reported:Just when you thought it was safe to dive in the water, Europe again sends risk assets sinking on concerns that Greece has not done enough to satisfy its EU lenders.Relations between Germany and Greece seem particularly chilly, sending a shudder through the markets that pushed Treasuries yields lower, led by the long end. It wasn't until late that stocks rallied from more than -10, back to near unchanged, when Reuters reported Greece's New Democracy's Samaras would commit to austerity (that's all it takes now-a-days).We saw two-way from central banks, early domestic real money buying of 10s and 30s from a few accounts, foreign real money buying of 7s, and later some domestic selling in 7s and 10s.

Sentiment was supported by news over the increasing participation rate for the Greek debt swap as well as expectations of another good employment report from the US. News that some further QE from the US is still possible was another positive factor.At noon, China, Taiwan and Singapore were up by more than 1% while Hong Kong and Philippines, were up by 0.8%.

This dragged the front end of the NDIRS curve down by 4-5bp.Although liquidity was expected to be returned by the banks after the Lunar New Year break, the amount seems to be larger-than-expected given the sharp drop in the fixing. Hence, there was market chatter that the PBOC might have rolled over some of the maturing 14d reverse repos it conducted before the holiday break.In India, the RBI will conduct INR100bn of bond purchases via its open market operations today, which will likely support today's INR130bn of government bond auctions.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed March 14, 2012 US indices surged to a new high while the Nikkei started strong.OCBC Investment Research said:The surge by the US indices to another new multi-year high, together with the strong Nikkei start (+1.8% currently) is likely to inspire the local bourse to a great start this morning.As a recap, the STI had started to show some signs of recovery yesterday; after a 0.5% higher opening, the index climbed steadily for the rest of the session to end more than 0.9% in the black.And with today's tone likely to remain buoyant, we could see the index breaking out of its 1-month downtrend channel and above the 3000 key psychological resistance with relative ease, before heading for the next resistance at around 3030 (key peak in Feb '12).On the downside, we still see the key support at 2900 (key resistance-turned-support), followed by the subsequent base at 2874 (minor trough in Jan '12).IG Markets Singapore, on the other hand, noted:Traders will be hoping the strong session on Wall Street last night provides some impetus for a good day ahead for the STI. Yesterday the local market ended up 0.9% to move within touching distance of the psychological 3,000 mark. The growing optimism coming out of the US is likely to warm the hearts of traders across the region, having already boosted risk-on mentalities among American investors.Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7% at 13178. The S&P advanced 1.8% to 1396 and the NASDAQ climbed 1.9% to finish at 3040.A three-pronged attack on the bears last night pushed US and European stocks higher. The Fed gave a rosier outlook for the US economy in its FMOC monthly meeting, retail sales jumped jumped 1.1% in February, the most in five months while 15 out of the 19 largest US banks passed stress tests.But of course all this good news means QE3 slips further down the agenda and timetable for the Fed which put some downward pressure on commodities. Spot gold was one of the biggest casualties falling more than 1% to its lowest price since January while gold futures for April delivery fell below $1700 as hopes of cheap US liquidity fade.RBS meanwhile reported (for 13 March 2012 trading):The bulk of the day saw a steepening selloff into the 10yr auction, sparked by better growth data in the US, most notably the US retail sales report.Last Friday saw street-wide downward revisions to GDP forecasts after the Trade report, but today's retail sales data caused these forecasts to be revised back higher to near 2% for Q1.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri March 30, 2012 Nikkei started poor and overnight there were mixed reactions on Wall Street.OCBC Investment Research said:The mixed reactions on Wall Street overnight and the poor Nikkei start are unlikely to provide any positive cues to the local bourse this morning.After opening 0.5% lower and slipping further to a 0.7% loss by the close yesterday, the STI is now hovering just above its 3-month uptrend support line at the moment.It will not be surprising to see the STI initiating a technical rebound at this point. But should this rebound proved unsustainable in the days ahead, we could see the index heading further south towards the 2975 support (recent trough) for a test.Beyond that, the subsequent base lies at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support. On the upside, we still see 3030 as the vital obstacle to overcome, with the next resistance marked at the 3075 support-turned-resistance.IG Markets Singapore meanwhile noted:Despite risk aversion coming back into the market lately this quarter has been one of the strongest for many years.The three catalysts for this year’s rally have been central banks’ largesse, an improving US economy and the easing of tensions in the Eurozone, specifically Greece. While more central bank liquidity is still a possibility, any future quantitative easing is less likely to have the same impact second or third time around. The US economy is still on the mend but has been faltering of late.In Europe, while a Greek tragedy was avoided there are still worries over the region’s other weak economies including Spain, Italy and Portugal. Plans are being drawn up to build a firewall to protect for such an eventuality but there’s still the big question of how this is going to be funded.So as we head into the second quarter it’s hard to know whether any of these three drivers can keep on pushing markets higher. At these current levels, equities are starting to look a little tired.The STI is definitely in need of a catalyst after two days of retreat. Although looking at the bigger picture, it is up more than 13% this quarter and investor confidence is in much better shape than the end of the previous quarter.On Wall Street last night the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% although the selloff could have been greater. Unemployment claims fell to a four-year low although the numbers were broadly in line with expectations.US revised GDP and consumer confidence levels also came in as expected which failed to excite the markets.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Wed Jan 18, 2012 Recovery on Wall Street not likely to help much.OCBC Investment Research said:Despite the recovery on Wall Street overnight, it is unlikely to have much positive impact on the local bourse this morning as the STI had already raced ahead with a strong 2.2% surge yesterday on significant pick-up in trading volume.With the key resistance at 2793 now convincingly retaken, we could potentially see the index trending higher towards the 2910 key support-turned-resistance in the medium term as sentiments improve further.However, we do not rule out a near-term technical correction to retest the newly established resistance-turned-support at 2793 in the days ahead following the index's recent sharp rally.Beyond the 2910 key resistance, we see the subsequent obstacle at the 3000 key psychological resistance. On the downside, the subsequent base is now pegged at 2735 (minor resistance-turned-support and 100-DMA).Meanwhile GFT noted:The euro may have ended the North American trading session higher against the U.S. dollar but the rally is losing momentum. After a completely illogical reaction to the downgrades by Standard & Poor’s, EUR/USD traders may finally be waking up to the troubles that lie ahead for the Eurozone.We have previously pointed out that even though the downgrades may have been expected by some traders, the impact on borrowing costs will place an undue burden on troubled nations, pushing them to the brink of default.In fact, one of the biggest stories today was the growing possibility of a default by Greece who will be holding discussions with their creditors on January 20th. If the discussions do not go well and additional aid is not disbursed, the country could default on its March loan payments as predicted by rating agency Fitch.Hungary is in its own mess with the European Union threatening to sue the government for trying to sway the central bank. With 80 percent of its exports destined for the EU, the country has been deeply affected by the region’s debt crisis.The country is currently in talks with the IMF for a bailout package but according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Hungary will not receive the package that they want. Instead, any aid will come with a number of harsh conditions.The downgrades have continued with Standard & Poor’s slashing the ratings of European banks and insurers.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Jan 19, 2012 Expect the local bourse to open higher today, thanks to the strong recovery on Wall Street and positive Nikkei start.OCBC Investment Research said:Following the strong recovery on Wall Street overnight and the similarly strong Nikkei start (+0.8%), we are likely to see the local bourse opening higher this morning.Despite climbing as much as 0.3% higher yesterday morning, the STI gave up all the prior gains after lunch to end the day nearly 0.7% back in the red.And with yesterday’s technical correction coming to a stop just above the 2793 resistance-turned-support, we could see the index rebounding off that level today and continue its recovery in the direction of the next key support-turned-resistance at 2910.Above 2910, we still see the subsequent obstacle at the 3000 key psychological level. On the downside, the subsequent base remains pegged at 2735 (minor resistance-turned-support and 100-DMA).Meanwhile GFT noted:The U.S. dollar lost value against all of the major currencies which is good for the market because it means investors have grown less risk averse. How long the easing of safe haven flows will last remains to be seen but for the time being, many currencies including the euro are experiencing strong rallies.This morning’s U.S. economic reports do little to threaten the improvement in risk. Producer prices fell 0.1 percent last month, but excluding food and energy costs, prices rose 0.3 percent.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs March 1, 2012 There was retreat on Wall Street amidst the STI's mini-recovery.OCBC Investment Research said:The retreat on Wall Street overnight is likely to spook the local bourse to a negative opening this morning but the strong Nikkei start (up 1.3% now) could limit the damage.Following the rebound on Tuesday, the STI continued inching higher yesterday; after a 0.4% higher opening, the index recovered further to a 0.8% gain at the close.With today's tone likely to turn a tad more downside biased, the index is likely to remain capped at below the 3000 psychological resistance in the near term. Beyond this immediate resistance, we see the subsequent obstacle at the 3031 recent peak.On the downside, we see the immediate base at the 2947 recent trough formed, followed by the subsequent support at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support region.IG Markets Singapore, on the other hand, reported:The STI has enjoyed healthy gains as it stages a mini-recovery back towards 3,000 and will see its resolve tested today as traders react to an action-packed night of news from the global economy.US and Europe went into overdrive last night with cheap money flooding one continent while being held back in another. This led to some clear winners (the US economy and European banks) and big losers (US equities and notably gold).First up was Ben Bernanke, whose comments can move the markets like no other. And he had a lot to say as he gave a testimony to US Congress. Oil prices may cause a spike in inflation, the jobs market is improving faster than expected and quantitative easing is unlikely to happen anytime soon.This last point had a huge impact on the markets, not least gold which slipped almost 5% as signs of a strengthening US economy reduced its need as a safe haven. Also some of the expected QE3 cash would have made its way into the precious metals markets.US equities took the brunt of the disappointment with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping 0.4% back below 13,000. The S&P 500 dropped 0.5% while the NASDAQ fell 0.7%.RBS meanwhile noted:After the much anticipated LTRO came and went as expected, investors turned their attention to the US data and Chairman Bernanke's testimony. The combination of the two sent yields higher, equities lower, commodities lower (though energy rebounded into the close), and the dollar higher.The way I saw the combined moves was as follows: with the second LTRO operation behind us, there is no third. Bernanke did not quash hopes of QE3, but he also did not trumpet QE3 as much as some apparently hoped.Thus, markets reacted in a way that reflected investors' realization that while there is plenty of liquidity in the system (and central bank balance sheets are large), there are no liquidity adding operations on the horizon.So perhaps it is time to dial back on liquidity fuelled positions. So the typical ""printing press"" hedges were in retreat, with often nasty intraday moves (for example, Gold fell ~$50 in a few minutes alone).Equities and the Euro/the dollar traded in a similar fashion and in the bigger picture, this may not be unreasonable considering the healthy run ""risk assets"" have had since the first LTRO on December 2nd, all the way into today's second LTRO.Also, while this summary reads like a day yields had large sized moves, 10yr yields rose approximately 5bps close-to-close. So despite a very interesting day in global markets, good old 10yr notes closed once again just a few bps off our familiar mid-point of the November-February range of 1.95%.",0.11881795525550842,0.8526995778083801,0.028482483699917793

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues March 27, 2012 Equities, commodities, currencies, and treasuries all were impacted by FOMC Chair Ben Bernanke’s comments.OCBC Investment Research said:The rally on Wall Street overnight and the strong Nikkei start (+1.4% now) are likely to inspire the local bourse to a strong opening this morning.As a recap, the STI slipped further south yesterday despite a positive start; after climbing as much as 0.2% at one point, the index fell into the red and closed 0.5% lower.But with today's tone likely to improve significantly, we could see the index rebounding at its 3-month uptrend support before recovering further to retest the 3030 (recent peaks) key obstacle.Above that, the subsequent resistance lies at 3075 (support-turned-resistance). On the downside, we still see the immediate base at the 2960 support (recent minor trough), followed by the subsequent base at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.GFT meanwhile reported (for 26 March 2012 trading):This morning’s comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had a major impact on currencies, equities, commodities and Treasuries. Speaking on the topic of unemployment, Bernanke made it clear that low interest rates and a large asset purchase program is needed to keep the recovery going.On the surface the key takeaway from Bernanke’s speech was that contrary to popular belief, the Fed is still thinking about increasing stimulus. They haven’t made any decisions yet but they indicated that in order for recovery to turn into growth monetary policy needs to remain accommodative.Out goes the idea of a 2013 rate hike – which is an important takeaway from Bernanke’s speech but the main takeaway is that the central bank is not happy with the recent movement in Treasuries.To the frustration of the Federal Reserve, bond yields have been slowly creeping higher with the 10-year bond yield rising to a 5 month high of 2.39 percent last week. Considering that the yield was at 2 percent as recently as March 7th, the huge increase was enough for the Fed Chairman to adjust his tone.When the Fed last met on March 13th, Bernanke acknowledged the improvements in the U.S. economy, leading investors to believe that additional stimulus was no longer necessary. The day before the FOMC announcement, the U.S. 10 year yield settled at 2.04 percent but a week later it rose 17 percent.All of the Federal Reserve’s efforts have been aimed at keeping yields low so you can imagine why the rise in yields motivated Bernanke to reset interest rate expectations. Based on the sell-off in the U.S. dollar, rise in stocks and commodities, the message was received loud and clear by most investors.Unfortunately bond traders weren’t in the loop as the 10 year bond yield rose on the day. If we are right about Bernanke’s motivation, then we can expect more dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials until bond yields decline to more comfortable levels.",0.2461518496274948,0.6331806182861328,0.1206674724817276
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues Feb 21, 2012 Nikkei is having a flat start while the STI is expected to keep up its momentum.Justin Harper, IG Markets Singapore head of research, said:The STI staged an eleventh-hour rally yesterday and will be looking to keep up the momentum today although the catalyst is unclear. Up a healthy 0.7% to 3021.2, the STI could start the next leg of this bull run which has seen it put on 14% since the start of the year.Yesterday the markets were massively buoyed by China’s easing of monetary policy coupled with progress in EU talks over the latest Greek debt settlement. While an agreement looks likely to be signed in the coming days, this may now well be priced into the markets with a bout of “buy on the rumour, sell on the fact” mentality taking hold.But while a short-term pullback can’t be ruled out the longer-term picture of Europe’s health, and the staving off of a messy default, may give markets some positive direction for the coming months.However, when it comes to Europe it is never that simple as upbeat news is always tainted with fearfully negative news. Today’s helping is the worry that Greece may need a third bailout as its economy is likely to suffer so much from the austerity measures it has agreed to.Meanwhile OCBC Investment Research noted:With US market closed for public holiday overnight and the Nikkei having a muted start (flat at the moment), these are unlikely to provide any significant inspiration to the local bourse this morning.Meanwhile, the STI continued to inch higher in the last session; after opening 0.7% in the black, the index pull backed to the 3000 psychological level but recovered to end the day back at its opening level again.But with today's tone likely to turn more muted, we could see the index consolidating around current levels with the 3000 being the immediate support and the subsequent base at the 2950 recent minor trough.On the upside, the immediate obstacle is pegged at around 3050 (support-turned-resistance), with the next resistance at the 3100 psychological resistance.",0.7552758455276489,0.17749033868312836,0.06723378598690033
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Feb 9, 2012 Good Wall Street news offers some positivity to today's trading.OCBC Investment Research said:The further recovery on Wall Street overnight is likely to cue the local bourse to a positive start this morning although the mildly negative Nikkei (-0.4% now) could limit the gains.As a recap, the STI trended higher to another 0.8% gain at the close yesterday as investors continued to pick up more shares on the improving sentiments.And with today's outlook likely to remain more upside biased, we could see the index reaching higher to test the 3000 key psychological resistance very soon.Above 3000, the next resistance lies around 3070 (support-turned-resistance). On the downside, the 2931-2939 gap support is still the initial base to watch out for, with the subsequent support at 2874 (recent trough).GFT, on the other hand, reported:The U.S. dollar strengthened against all of the major currencies today despite a warning by Standard & Poor’s that the U.S. credit rating could be lowered again in the next 6 to 24 months if a medium term fiscal plan is not developed.Political gridlock in Washington and opposition to raising the debt ceiling last year prompted S&P to strip the U.S. of its prized AAA rating in August. If the winner of the November elections fails to come up with a credible plan to reduce the deficit, the U.S. could face another downgrade by S&P and/or a follow up move by Fitch and Moody’s.No U.S. economic data was released today but according to Federal Reserve President Williams who is a voting member of the FOMC this year, the Fed may need to increase asset purchases if growth falters. He believes that there is limited headroom to buy Treasuries but there is room for purchases of mortgage bonds.Like Bernanke, he does not buy the recent improvement in the labor market. Instead, he believes that the unemployment rate will exceed 8 percent into 2013 and be well over 7 percent by the end of 2014. Meanwhile RBS noted:Our European trader called it ""quietest day of the year and it very much feels like the calm before the storm."" While I wouldn't quantify today's Treasury activity as the quietest day of the year, it was certainly a day of stability for asset prices, as we await more news on Greece (again), and as the Treasury placed $24bn shiny new 10yr notes without much of an issue.While flows in Europe were on the light side, in Treasuries our larger flows were on the sell-side: leveraged selling in 5s, 10s, and 30s and real money selling in 10s and 30s. We also had some foreign selling in 5s and central bank selling in 10s.The swaps desk had early insurance receiving in the long end as well as paying from servicers and rate lock unwinds, and we had some spec buying in 10yr and 30yr futures. Total Treasury broker volume today was 72% of the 10-day average.",0.1915270984172821,0.7511696219444275,0.057303279638290405
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri March 16, 2012 Wall Street continued its bull run while the STI sat above 3,000.IG Markets Singapore said:It has been in a few years since the STI sat above 3,000 while the S&P 500 was above1,400 – but that is the enviable position we find ourselves in this morning.Last night Wall Street continued its bull run as manufacturing in the New York region, underlying inflation and jobless claims numbers all came in better than expected. It helped propel the S&P back above 1,400 – the first time it has breached this level for nearly four years.While the S&P 500 was up 0.6% last night the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4% to close at 13,253, its highest finish since December 2007.These post-GFC highs come in the same week as the STI moved above 3,000 and looking like it might end the week on a high, unless of course China has a trick up its sleeve.The Chinese government has done its best to rock regional stocks recently. In under a fortnight China has revised its GDP growth downwards, revealed a record high trade deficit and warned that its housing market still hasn’t cooled down enough. But for now the bulls have plenty of grist for their mill as markets hit cyclical highs from more positive economic data. The USD has also given up a little ground which is good news for commodities.Meanwhile RBS reported (for 15 March 2012 trading):Volumes were huge overnight (some said 3rd highest for an overnight on record), and busy during the day but not at the same hectic pace.Chronologically, we saw central bank selling in 10s, two-way from real money in 10s, macro buying of 10s, foreign real money selling of the belly, US real money buying of 10s, and leveraged buying of 10s.Also throughout was decent interest in the front end from a variety of accounts, especially once the market stabilized (cash, Euros, 1y1y rate, etc). In TIPS we saw buying of 2yr and 10yr TIPS, selling of 3yr TIPS, and 2 way flow in 30s, skewed to better buying.Total Treasury broker volume today was 141% of the 10-day average.OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, noted (for 15 March 2012 trading):The further recovery by US indices to another new multi-year high is likely to cue the local bourse to a more optimistic start this morning.Following Wednesday's strong rally, the STI headed into a consolidation mode yesterday; after opening flat, the index traded in a muted fashion for the rest of the day before closing unchanged.But with today's tone likely to turn more upside biased, we could see the index testing the 3030 (key peak in Feb '12) immediate resistance again. A bullish break above this level could see it climbing towards the 3055 support-turned-resistance.On the downside, 3000 psychological level is still the immediate support for now, with the subsequent base pegged at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support.",0.918721079826355,0.04133007675409317,0.03994888812303543
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri March 9, 2012 US stocks rallied overnight and the Nikkei gained 2%, along with the STI.IG Markets Singapore said:The bounce back continued last night as US stocks rallied on news that the Greek debt swap was almost at a successful conclusion.The S&P 500 put on its biggest two-day advance of the year, gaining 1% last night while the tech-heavy NASDAQ was up 1.2%. The US has also seen risk-on sentiment returning thanks to improving jobs data.This could get another boost tonight with non-farms payroll data hinting at another leap in employment which supports the continuing US economic recovery story.All this points to a good day ahead for Asia, which is in the throngs of its own mini recovery. Both the STI and the Nikkei 225 gained 2% yesterday as they looked to reverse mid-week losses. RBS, on the other hand, noted (for 8 March 2012 trading):US investors awoke to risk ON with global stock markets rallying, commodities higher, and the dollar lower. Nothing changed in the NY session, with the main themes being optimism on the Greek PSI and QE3, and the moves came at the expense of the Treasury market which bear steepened throughout the duration.The high of the day was at the buyback, but the bid was brief and Treasuries never recovered towards yesterday's marks. Contrary to the price action we saw better buying from central banks in 7s, 10s, and 30s, as well as leveraged buying in 10s and domestic real money selling in 5s. Our swaps flows were mixed without any major themes.Total Treasury broker volume today was 90% of the 10-day average. In Mortgages, we saw mixed flows but skewed to better buying, 3.5s were 4 ticks tighter to swaps as one point but in the afternoon turned the other way. While they still closed ~2 ticks better, it felt as if there was some supply out of the originators ahead of payrolls. Origination was ~$2.25bn. OCBC Investment Research meanwhile reported:The continued recovery on Wall Street overnight and the strong Nikkei start (+1.2% currently) are likely to cue the local bourse to further gains at the open this morning.With the STI rallying to a 2% higher close following a 0.5% gain at the open yesterday, this could provide the much needed confidence to investors that the recent sharp correction could be fairly short term in nature.With the strong rebound off the 2900 key level seen yesterday, this critical level has been proven to be a vital resistance-turned-support; as long as this key support holds its ground, there is no major cause of concern for medium to long term investors.Below that, we see the subsequent base at around 2874 (minor trough in Jan '12). On the upside, we still see 3000 as the key obstacle to overcome in the near term, with the subsequent resistance pegged at 3030 (key peak in Feb '12).",0.9234296679496765,0.040404096245765686,0.03616621345281601
"Frasers Centrepoint Trust’s 48m new stocks over 4 times subscribed New units priced at S$1.39 each received strong demand from more than 30 institutional investors.According to a release, Frasers Centrepoint Asset Management Ltd., the manager of Frasers Centrepoint Trust, announced the successful completion of the private placement of 48.0 million new units in FCT at an offering price of S$1.39 per unit.The Offering Price, which has been fixed at the top end of the offering price range of S$1.35 and S$1.39, was determined following the completion of a book-building process which was approximately 4.1 times subscribed on the back of strong demand from more than 30 new and existing Asian and European institutional investors.The Offering Price represents a discount of approximately 2.5% to FCT’s adjusted1 volume weighted average price of S$1.426 per unit for trades done on the full market day on 14 September 2011. The gross proceeds and net proceeds from this placement which amounts to approximately S$66.7 million and S$64.3 million respectively, will be used to part-finance the acquisition of Bedok Point.Mr Philip Eng, Chairman of FCAM, said, “The strong investor demand for the placement in FCT’s units amidst a volatile market environment, demonstrates investors’ confidence in FCT’s growth strategy and its potential to deliver attractive total returns to its unitholders.”Dr Chew Tuan Chiong, CEO of FCAM, said, “We are delighted with the strong subscription for the placement and we thank investors for their solid support in FCT.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri Feb 24, 2012 Overnight there was improvement in risk sentiment across Europe and the US.IG Markets Singapore said:The STI will be hoping to put the brakes on its two-day downward spiral today buoyed by an improvement in risk sentiment across Europe and the US last night. But this might be short-lived.Singapore traders have not had much reason to be cheerful after the Greek bailout package earlier this week as global markets started to slide. Greece has been the focal point for so long that markets had forgotten to check on the state of the global economy.This week we saw that recovery is still some way off with many sub-50 PMI manufacturing figures being posted across Europe and China. But last night we saw tiny steps are being made in the right direction with US unemployment claims data beating expectations and holding steady at four-year lows. Housing data also showed some improvement.This saw the S&P 500 trade near 10-month highs and the Dow once again flirt with the 13,000 level. Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4% to close at 12986. The S&P was also 0.4% higher at 1363, while the NASDAQ climbed 0.8% to finish at 2957.With US markets once again approaching key levels, ‘Dow 13,000’, and the S&P edging up to its post- GFC high of 1370, one hopes some of this magic dust can be sprinkled onto the STI today to end the week on a more positive note. The loss in value of 2% is unlikely to be reversed today, but traders will be hoping at least this slippage doesn’t worsen.But the omens don’t look good for a number of reasons. Firstly, industrial production figures for Singapore are due out this lunchtime. There’s a strong chance output shrank in January as the global economy was still very bleak before rays of sunshine started breaking through.Secondly, oil has continued to rise with US crude edging up 1.5% to $107.49 a barrel while oil futures are climbing on the back or Iranian tension not dying down anytime soon. Rising oil prices are not good for energy-hungry economies.Thirdly, China is now downgrading its economic expansion this year arguing its current growth model is unstable and more importantly, unsustainable. This is not good for China’s trading partners who rely on it for exports and the catalyst for Asian growth.RBS, on the other hand, reported:Treasuries staged a flattening rally today, bounding off the opening lows due to the LCH action and as stocks softened up early. In addition, Treasuries were supported by strong retail demand at the 7yr auction and talk of additional Fed easing in the market in April.This talk also supported commodities, including oil, helping the Treasury bid due to the negative impact rising energy has on consumption. Our flows were better selling in the morning from leveraged and macro accounts in 5s and 10s, and better paying in swaps. Flows into the afternoon as the market turned around became more mixed, with some real money two way in 3s and buying in 5s.As for TIPS, we saw real money buying the front end, 10s, and 12s and selling the long end. Total Treasury broker volume today was 94% of the 10-day average.Meanwhile GFT noted:The question then becomes how much of an impact a Greek default would have on the markets. Psychologically it would be significant because it is a first for the Eurozone.Fears of contagion could freeze the markets quickly as investors turn their focus to the risk of contagion. If a default were to occur, the euro and European financial markets would take their cue from European yields and the CDS spreads of Italy, Spain and Portugal.The next 2 weeks will be extremely important to Greece and the financial markets as a whole but from now until then, things could be quieter unless the second bailout fails in any Parliamentary vote.Germany will be holding a vote on Monday and Merkel won’t gain support from local lawmakers easily. In early March, European Union leaders will meet to give their final seal of approval for the deal.Although we believe that a default would have significant repercussions for the euro and the financial markets in general, it may not mean the end of the world. Investors survived the U.S.’ loss of their AAA rating and the downgrade of France – they even survived the demise of century old Wall Street institutions, albeit after some severe pain.If Greece were to default and credit default swap payments were made, at least faith in these instruments would be restored and investors would not have to wonder if banks, policymakers and ISDA will bend the rules in a crisis.",0.2609459459781647,0.6492807269096375,0.08977331966161728
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon March 12, 2012 Modest gains closed the past week for US stocks, while the Nikkei is off to a positive start.IG Markets Singapore said:Singapore traders had been hoping for the dust to settle on the Greek debt swap before working out their next move. But they won’t have much time with China’s trade deficit now muddying the waters. The picture of the global economy’s health is as hazy as a Beijing skyline. On the one hand, Greece appears to be saved for now by a forceful debt swap. This makes the eurozone’s future look safer while the US is continuing to slowly recover with improving employment figures.But there are also big worries about China’s slowdown, supported by the weekend’s revelations that its trade balance plunged $31.5 billion into the red in February as exports slumped. And euro sceptics are quick to point out Greece’s problems are the tip of the iceberg, with Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland all on the fringes of default. Plus Greece could also need bailout version 3.All this uncertainty could lead to another cautious week for Singapore which had a rollercoaster ride last week. Figures show that traders in Singapore have been reducing their exposure to equities, not just across the region but US stocks also.While the figures don’t capture the renewed optimism in the US economy, they do highlight how willing traders are to sell-up and sit things out until things look clearer for global markets. RBS, on the other hand, reported (for 9 March 2012 trading):Treasuries bear steepened today after a slightly better than expected Employment report and higher stocks put next week's supply front and center for fixed income traders.We saw better buying on the dip in general, with receiving in 10s from real money, central bank buying in 2s and 10s, and some foreign real money selling in 7s.In TIPS, we saw small better buying across the curve. An uptick in gas gave some life to the front end, and breakevens ground to 3-4 wider.Total Treasury broker volume today was 105% of the 10-day average.OCBC Investment Research meanwhile noted:The modest gains on Wall Street last Friday night and the positive Nikkei start (+0.6% currently) could inspire the local bourse to a mildly optimistic start this morning.However, it is unlikely that we will see any strong rally today as the STI has displayed signs of weakening upside momentum in the previous session; despite gaining as much as 0.6% at one stage, the index retreated to end Friday more than 0.2% in the red.For now, the index could continue to drift lower steadily within its near 1-month downtrend channel with the immediate base still marked at the 2900 key resistance-turned-support, with the subsequent support lying at 2874 (minor trough in Jan '12).On the upside, we still see 3000 as the key obstacle to overcome in the near term, with the subsequent resistance pegged at 3030 (key peak in Feb '12).",0.8239931464195251,0.13156382739543915,0.04444302245974541
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Fri Jan 13, 2012 Singapore finds support from Nikkei strength and Wall Street gains.- OCBC Investment Research said continued gains on Wall Street overnight and a strong Nikkei start (+1.0%) could buoy the local bourse.The STI, which closed 0.1% lower yesterday, continue to push for the next key resistance at 2800, although the index could run into pretty stiff resistance around 2793 (early Dec 11 high, also 38.2% retracement of fall from 3227-2521).But they’re not ruling out possible profit-taking later in the day as investors lighten up positions ahead of the weekend. On the downside, they continue to peg the initial support at 2727 (50-day moving average), ahead of 2700.US equities advanced on European optimism after the ECB left interest rates unchanged and borrowing costs declined at Spanish and Italian bond auctions. Investors overlooked disappointing US economic data, which saw weekly jobless claims rise and retail sales rising less than expected.Crude for Feb delivery fell sharply late in the trading session after a report suggested that an embargo on Iranian oil imports to Europe would be put off by six months to allow for the procurement of alternate supplies. Prices fell US$1.77, or 1.8%, to close at US$99.10/barrel.Gold for Feb delivery gained US$8.10, or 0.5%, to settle at U$1,647.70/ounce on the back of a weak US dollar. Mar silver also edged higher by 23 cents, or 0.8%, to end at US$30.12/ounce.- RBS said the EUR surged during the NY morning after the ECB left the benchmark rate unchanged in what felt like a short squeeze. EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD, two short EUR positions that were extremely oversold on the RSI, rallied sharply and EUR/AUD in particular would complete a bullish daily reversal off its all-time low with a close above 1.2406.",0.6501547694206238,0.32580140233039856,0.024043841287493706
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs March 29, 2012 Softer open for the STI is expected today following losses on Wall Street overnight.IG Markets Singapore said:News that the US is swimming in oil put the skids on commodity producers last night and led to another session of losses on Wall Street. Sentiment wasn’t helped by disappointing durable goods orders which came in weaker than expected.Among the major averages, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5% at 13126. The S&P was 0.5% lower at 1406 and the NASDAQ also shed 0.5% to finish at 3105. Risk appetite was generally subdued with commodities and risk currencies losing ground. Stocks were choppy through most of the European session, until the durable-goods orders data triggered the sharp move lower. Although the oil price retreat led to some decline in equities, once the dust settles it could increase risk sentiment if traders believe strategies are in place to stop oil rising to growth-crippling levels and to deal with supply constraints from Iran.This argument was helped by developments in Europe where its biggest economic powers, including France and the UK, appear to be in talks with the US over a concerted effort to release emergency supplies.The fact that the US has built up more than 7 million barrels in stockpiles will also calm fears that the world’s biggest crude oil consumer won’t have a big enough cushion to ride out the Middle Eastern tensions.Since the Iranian crisis escalated when the EU announced a July embargo, panic had set the tone about lack of reserves and supply side issues. These fears have not been substantiated. It now appears energy-hungry nations may be in a much stronger position to cushion themselves when the Iranian oil tap is turned off in July.WTI crude is currently trading down 1.8% at US$105.41 a barrel while Brent slipped 0.8% to sit at $125.04.But yet another retreat in US equities reminds traders that this rally won't be a straight line heading north. There have been a few wobbles and these are likely to remain so even when the trend is upwards.Yesterday the STI proved its resilience dropping just 0.1% after the Bernanke Bounce helped it gain 1.5% the previous day. Today looks likely to be another challenging day for the local market given the Wall Street wobble last night.There could also be some fallout from news that China’s corporate profits won’t grow at all this year. The futures market is pointing at a softer open for the STI this morning.RBS meanwhile reported (for 28 March 2012 trading):Treasuries stalled a bit today against decent resistances of 1% in 5yrs (currents) and ~2.16% in 10yrs. Still, the market has not backed up much either, supported today by weaker global equities, a bit more unease on Europe, and slightly softer data (emphasis on slightly).The auction tail on its own makes it look like a sloppy auction, but after the morning buyback showed the lowest offer/cover ration in that sector since Twist began, the market rallied and we auctioned them near the highs. It had a feel of the ""sell into the buyback, cover at auction"" trade going bad, and it appeared the rally took out some of those shorts beforehand.Overall I would call the auction fine, considering. We saw foreign real money buying 3s and selling 10s (separate transactions), macro selling of 10s, and real money buying of 3s and 10s. The swaps desk saw we saw hedge funds favouring ""low for longer"" trades, receiving in the belly and paying in the long end.In TIPS, we saw real money selling of 5s, 10s, and 30s.

"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Mon Jan 30, 2012 Looks like the bourse is going to be off to a bad start.OCBC Investment Research said:The muted closing on Wall Street overnight, coupled with the weak Nikkei start (opened 0.4% lower), is likely to weigh on local sentiment this morning, especially after the recent strong gains.As such, the STI, which ended 0.9% higher Friday, could stage a pullback to retest the key 2900 support.Below that, we peg the next support at the 2852-2860 (gap support formed recently).On the upside, we see the initial cap at 2916 (Friday’s high/close), ahead of the key 3000 psychological level.",0.055899426341056824,0.9019079804420471,0.04219263419508934
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Tues Jan 31, 2012 The bourse is not likely to get much boost from Wall Street and the Nikkei.OCBC Investment Research said:The mild retreat on Wall Street overnight and the muted Nikkei start (-0.1% at the moment) are unlikely to provide any inspiration to the local bourse this morning.With the STI having already retreated some 1% yesterday after facing strong selling pressure at the 2916 key support-turned-resistance, we could potentially see a further technical pullback by the index in the days ahead.In the near term, the 2852-2860 gap support is still a relatively strong base but should that level be compromised, it will not be surprising to see the index retreating further south to the 2790 key resistance-turned-support.Above the still unconquered obstacle at 2916, we continue to see the subsequent key resistance at the 3000 psychological level.RBS noted:We returned to the recurring pattern of a European based risk-off trade where risk assets recover after Europe goes home. The intraday low in the S&P500 occurred at 10:15 AM (-16 points), and since then it was a slow grind higher in equities following a day where European bourses posted -1% -1.5% losses.Treasuries opened with a strong bull flattening bid, for with 5yrs running out of room as we approach 0.70%, investors seeking price appreciation are being forced further out the curve. The bid to Treasuries did not relent even as US equities rallied back – a mixture of events that are sure to make policy makers smile (Treasury yields lower and equities stable at higher levels).Our flows were central bank buying of 7s, macro selling of the long end, and light domestic interest in 10s. The swap desk saw better receiving in 5yrs and 10yr spreads. Total Treasury broker volume today was 77% of the 10-day average.GFT, on the other hand, reported:The recent improvement in risk appetite has driven the U.S. dollar sharply lower against all of the major currencies. Today however was a day of recovery for the greenback which rose against everything except for the Japanese Yen.In fact, the weakness of USD/JPY is quite significant because the pair tumbled for 3 days straight, falling to a 2 month low in the process. This would not be as big of a deal if USD/JPY was trading at 80 but it is moving dangerously close to its record low which means Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance officials must be shaking in their seats.This is a big week for both Europe and the U.S. – U.S. stocks have performed extremely well, recovering nearly all of its intraday losses. Everyone seems to have the buy on dip mentality with strong earnings from tech companies such as Apple driving the enthusiasm in the market.",0.06823450326919556,0.8960055112838745,0.03575994446873665
"Singapore Markets Morning Briefing - what you need to know for Thurs Feb 2, 2012 Good news is that fairly strong opening is expected today.OCBC Investment Research said:With US stocks rallying overnight and the Nikkei starting positively (+0.8% now), these are likely to inspire the local bourse to a fairly strong opening this morning.As a recap, the STI continued to show strength yesterday despite facing some earlier selling pressure. At one point, the index was losing as much as 0.8% but towards the late afternoon, it recovered strongly to end the day just 0.1% lower.And with today's tone likely to turn more upside biased, we could see the index attempting another vital test of the still unconquered 2916 key obstacle (key support-turned-resistance). Meanwhile, the subsequent resistance is still pegged at the 3000 psychological level. On the downside, we still see the 2852-2860 gap support as a relatively strong base but should it be compromised, the next floor is at 2790 key resistance-turned-support.Meanwhile GFT reported:On Tuesday, we wrote that good news was needed quickly to prevent currencies from failing at key levels and good news was exactly what we had overnight.Despite concerns about slowing global demand, the Chinese manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in the month of January. Fears of a hard landing have been allayed by each piece of incoming Chinese data which tell us that at worst the Chinese economy will slow gradually this year.In the Eurozone, Germany’s PMI manufacturing index was also revised higher indicating the sector expanded at a faster pace last month. Although many experts including those within the European Central Bank believe that the Eurozone could be headed for recession this year, so far we have seen very little evidence of that in Germany or France, whose economies account for 48 percent of Eurozone GDP.Until there are consistently weak economic reports from either country, the threat of EZ recession will not be the market’s greatest concern.RBS, on the other hand, noted:Broadly stronger than expected global January PMI data helped fuel risk seeking sentiment during the NY session.In particular, the stronger data in China, the UK, and an upward revision to final Euro-area data boosted sentiment during the European morning and the 1 point rise in the US ISM manufacturing to 54.1 in January added to the positive environment for riskier assets and higher beta currencies.Amongst the G10 nations that have reported January data, only the PMIs in France and Switzerland declined in January. US equities rose during the morning session and held onto their gains into the close (S&P 500 closed 1324.08, up 11.67).",0.2402459979057312,0.7323046326637268,0.027449391782283783
