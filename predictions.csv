The three raised $520m during the month. All these three IPOs were subscribed seven to 36 times, which, according to GlobalData, reflects a strong investor sentiment. According to the GlobalData: ""SPAC is a quicker and more economical way for a company to go public. It is a shell company with no revenue-generating business and no prior operating history. It is necessary for a SPAC to announce the combination with a target operating company, referred to as a ‘de-SPAC’ transaction’, within 24 months of IPO listing and complete the transaction within 36 months.""“The emergence of SPAC IPOs in Singapore follows the implementation of new rules in September 2021 that enable blank-check companies to list on SGX’s mainboard. During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, blank-check companies (SPACs) remained one of the [favourite] forms of fundraising in the US. This also led to an increase in interest in SPACs in Asia, with Singapore and Hong Kong relaxing rules to allow blank-check companies to get listed on the mainboards of bourses,” said Keshav Kumar Jha, Business Fundamentals Analyst, GlobalData.",0.1299872100353241,0.01572982408106327,0.8542829751968384

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has recently announced its framework for special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listings on its platform.This makes it the first major Asian exchange to allow SPAC listings.Here are the eight key criteria that SPACs must meet in order to become SGX-listed, as shared by an RHB report:A minimum market capitalisation of $150m;De-SPAC must take place within 24 months of the initial public offering (IPO) (The SGX allows an extension of up to 12 months, subject to conditions);Moratorium on sponsor’s shares from IPO to de-SPAC, a 6-month moratorium after de-SPAC and for applicable resulting insurers, a further 6-month moratorium thereafter on 50% of shareholdings;Sponsors must subscribe to at least 2.5% to 3.5% of the IPO shares/units/warrants depending on the market capitalisation of the SPAC;Approval of more than 50% of the independent directors of the transaction, along with support from more than 50% of the shareholders.Warrants issued to shareholders will be detachable and maximum percentage dilution to shareholders arising from the conversion of warrants issued at IPO is capped at 50%;All independent shareholders are entitled to redemption rights; andSponsor’s promote limit of up to 20% of issued shares at IPO.The SGX will work with the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) on educating potential investors on this new process.In a Reuters report, JPMorgan co-head of Souteheast Asia investment banking, Vineet Mishra, said that fast-growing companies would now have access to markets previously reachable only to larger, established companies. “Companies in the real estate, consumer and infrastructure space have traditionally fuelled the growth in Singapore's capital markets. By expanding the products' range to include SPACs, there might be the opportunity for fast-growing companies to also access these markets,” Mishra said.

Stocks for the banking giant, DBS, traded at an all-time high of $31.74 on 11 August, Monday, the highest since 2 May 2018.This is according to the latest data from the Singapore Exchange (SGX), who noted that Singapore’s three top banks: DBS, OCBC, and UOB, recorded a combined net interest income of $5.13b in the second quarter.Together, the three banks also have a 2021 year-to-date total return of 24% as of 12 August, extending its 19% total returns from the first half.Combined wealth management net fee and commission income from the three banks was at $2.0b in the first half, almost tripling the $700m recorded in the same period 7 years ago.“In 1HFY21 the combined wealth management net fee and commission income, of the trio increased 21% from 2HFY20, which was the strongest sequential growth since the 31% growth in 1HFY17 from 2HFY16. Wealth Management was earmarked as a growth segment going into 1HFY21 with UOB noting that wealth management fees reached record levels amid returning investor confidence on the market recovery,” the SGX said in a report.Read more of SGX’s report here.",0.9399875998497009,0.01766892708837986,0.04234350472688675

7,"SPAC to attract more unicorns, tech players to list in SGX: EY Thanks to Singapore introducing guidelines for SPAC listings.According to a report by Ernst & Young (EY), the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is expected to attract new unicorns and technology players to list at the Singapore Exchange.This will follow Singapore's move to introduce guidelines for SPAC listings, together with various other funding and support initiatives to boost the listing market, said Max Loh, Singapore managing partner and ASEAN IPO leader at EY.In the third quarter, the Asia Pacific region registered a steady initial public offerings (IPO) performance, continuing the strong showing in the first half. It raised 750 IPOs translating to US$123.4b proceeds. Technology is the most active sector in the region by both deal numbers—154 IPOs out of the 750—and proceeds, US$34.3b.Greater China continued to see gains year-to-date, with 444 IPOs raising $127.75b (US$94.1b), a 13% and 20% increase compared to the previous quarter. However, the market experienced a halt of cross-border IPOs from the US market.Japan, meanwhile, had a similar increase with 50% in IPOs at 81 and an increase by 195% in proceeds at $5.43b (US$4b). The strong performance was due to the high liquidity, local stock market performance and overall improvement in sentiment due to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.In terms of exchanges, ASEAN remained steady, with 35 deals raising $4.61 (US$3.4b). The Indonesia Stock Exchange showed the most activity with 15 deals at $2.30b (US$ 1.7b) proceeds; followed by Thailand, nine deals at $520.04 (US$383m). Malaysia and the Philippines had seven deals raising $525.53 (US$387m) and three deals raising $1.34b (US$925m), respectively.“This reinforces the point that ASEAN corporates, in particular technology companies, continue to drive growth and seek capital to fund their growth aspirations. ASEAN exchanges are undergoing regulatory reform to attract and accommodate the listings of their homegrown companies on the domestic exchanges,” Loh said.According to Loh, however, there are signs of a temporary falloff in terms of IPO numbers and proceeds raised after many quarters of robust IPO activity. ""Some of the factors include geopolitical tensions between the US and China, the resurging COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory action across the region, which may stymie growth.""",0.9474695920944214,0.02556742914021015,0.02696303278207779

These amendments help to enhance flexibility for DR issuers and to increase investment options for investors. This initial collaboration between SGX and SET is a welcome addition to Thailand and Singapore cross-border development.

38,"Temasek, GIC poised to provide fresh funds to Singapore’s domestic stocks The Monetary Authority of Singapore is also slated to join the efforts. Temasek Holdings and GIC are slated to aid in the boosting of Singapore’s local stock market, according to a Bloomberg report.Temasek Holdings’ 65 Equity Partners Holdings is expected to invest in Singapore and regional mid-cap firms with a fund size of at least $1b. Initial public offerings are also covered by this fund. These companies will be persuaded to use the new framework for blank-cheque companies. This, in turn, will encourage the listing of tech companies in their portfolios. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is also expected to join their actions, with the regulator planning to add to its existing measure, a source disclosed to Bloomberg.In the past years, Singapore’s local bourse has shown signs of struggling, which can be attributed to tepid listings and low liquidity. The low presence of tech names has also affected interest in Singapore’s capital markets, as these have held status as one of the themes in global equity markets.Singapore Exchange’s move to present rules for the listing of SPACs is an attempt to control a worldwide phenomenon, as it is expected to attract listings from various industries.Currently, Temasek’s $381b portfolio contains 24% of local investments. These, however, are directed towards companies like Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecommunications.In a response to Bloomberg queries, Temasek sees this as an opportunity to present opportunities for innovation. “Temasek and its network of partners can be providers of catalytic capital, particularly in the areas of the longer-term structural trends we have identified: digitisation, sustainable living, longer life spans and the future of consumption,” Temasek said.The Ministry of Trade and Industry, MAS, GIC, and Singapore Exchange all declined to comment. According to Bloomberg sources, Temasek’s Tan Chong Lee is aiming to help lead 65 Equity Partners, with plans to go beyond  Singapore when needed. This company, as well as its UK entity, 65 Equity Partners Management, were established this year, as proven by regulatory filings in Singapore and the UK. Meanwhile, GIC has an estimated $731.97b (US$545b) in assets under management, as taken from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Its mandate has stopped it from investing domestically, with exceptions where revenue is generated outside Singapore, such as GLP and Esco Lifesciences Group.",0.16464529931545258,0.03091641142964363,0.8044382333755493
