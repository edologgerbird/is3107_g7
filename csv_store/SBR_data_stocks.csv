How the STI experienced the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"The past 12 trading sessions saw fuel and travel dependent airlines perform the least.A global trend was felt as the Straits Times Index (STI) reported increased volatility since the authorisation of military operations by President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.According to the Singapore Exchange's (SGX) latest market update, the period between 23 February and 11 March saw a decline in the STI by 4.2%, with both global bank stocks also contributing through a 6.8% decline. Following this trend, the FTSE Asia Pacific Index also slid by 5.7%.In terms of sectors, the oil and gas sector topped the global stocks, whilst fuel and travel dependent airlines are the least performing stocks over the past 12 trading sessions. On top of this, expectations for the pending US FOMC Rate hike dipping to 25 bps from 50 bps, have also resulted in banks being seen amongst the least performing sectors. Meanwhile, the REIT sector has shown promise as one of the most defensive sectors, alongside the energy and utility sectors.Sembcorp Industries led the STI in the same period, with five of the seven STI REITs making up the STI’s top 10 performers.Meanwhile, UOB, DBS, and OCBC Bank made up the least performing STI stocks for the period.During the same period, $740m of net institutional flow was logged by the index, with more STI stocks booking net inflows at 16 than net outflows at 14 over the same period. The three previously mentioned banks led in outflows as well, while averaging 7.5% in declines.On the other hand, leading in net institutional inflows were Singapore Telecommunications, Singapore Technologies Engineering, Wilmar International, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, and Sembcorp Industries.",https://sbr.com.sg/stocks/news/how-sti-experienced-effects-russia-ukraine-conflict,2022-03-15T09:58:25+0800,"{'B26': 'Ban Leong', '9CI': 'CapitaLandInvest', 'D05': 'DBS', 'DQEW': 'DBS 5xLongSG230713', 'DKBW': 'DBS 5xLongSG240306', 'DCAW': 'DBS 5xShortSG220331', 'DTFW': 'DBS 5xShortSG221201', 'DLDW': 'DBS 5xShortSG240306', 'KUO': 'Intl Cement', 'DMUW': 'OCBC 5xLongSG221201', 'DFJW': 'OCBC 5xShortSG221201', 'O39': 'OCBC Bank', 'P11': 'Pacific Andes', 'P15': 'Pacific Century', 'T8V': 'Pacific Radiance', 'U96': 'Sembcorp Ind', 'S51': 'Sembcorp Marine', 'S68': 'SGX', 'DGRW': 'SGX 5xLongSG220630', 'DGSW': 'SGX 5xShortSG220630', 'DYKW': 'SGX 5xShortSG230420', 'Z77': 'Singtel 10', 'DBYW': 'Singtel 5xLongSG231214', 'DKMW': 'Singtel 5xShortSG230713', 'ERKW': 'SingtelMBeCW220915', 'S63': 'ST Engineering', 'XNMW': 'STI 2850MBePW220428', 'YTCW': 'STI 3050MBePW220428', 'MWLW': 'STI 3100MBeCW220428', 'XHDW': 'STI 3300MBeCW220428', 'ES3': 'STI ETF', 'U11': 'UOB', 'DHBW': 'UOB 5xLongSG230713', 'DOGW': 'UOB 5xLongSG240306', 'DEZW': 'UOB 5xShortSG221201', 'DSMW': 'UOB 5xShortSG240306', 'DPBW': 'Wilmar 5xLongSG240306', 'DDBW': 'Wilmar 5xShortSG221201', 'DHGW': 'Wilmar 5xShortSG230825', 'F34': 'Wilmar Intl'}",,
SGX launches low carbon index in partnership with OCBC,"The index uses a methodology that singles out companies with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels.Going green was the next step forward as Singapore Exchange (SGX), in collaboration with OCBC, launched the iEdge-OCBC Singapore Low Carbon Select 50 Capped Index.Developed by SGX as part of the SGX Sustainability Indices product suite, the product was done in association with product specialists from the OCBC Group.A methodology was also applied that excludes entities that have a heavy presence in the fossil fuels sector. Best-in-class selections based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue, were also highlighted.Through this, the top 50 remaining companies by market capitalisation will make up the index, with a tiered capped weighting mechanism in place to enforce portfolio diversification.Mega cap stocks will be capped at 10%, with other constituents following suit at 7%.“The index provides an opportunity for investors to reduce the carbon footprint of their investment portfolios,” commented SGX.",https://sbr.com.sg/stocks/news/sgx-launches-low-carbon-index-in-partnership-ocbc,2022-03-15T09:34:52+0800,"{'CGN': 'Best World', 'DMUW': 'OCBC 5xLongSG221201', 'DFJW': 'OCBC 5xShortSG221201', 'O39': 'OCBC Bank', 'S68': 'SGX', 'DGRW': 'SGX 5xLongSG220630', 'DGSW': 'SGX 5xShortSG220630', 'DYKW': 'SGX 5xShortSG230420'}",,

Singapore primed to be the new hotspot for SPAC IPOs,"SPACS accounted for over 75% of total SGX listings.The Lion City is likely to emerge as the new hotspot for special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) initial public offerings (IPOs), according to the latest report by GlobalData.In the Singapore Exchange (SGX), around 75% of the total listings and 98% of total capital raised during January 22 were made up of SPACs or blank-check companies.Three SPAC IPOs—Vertex Technology Acquisition Corp (VTAC), Pegasus Asia (Pegasus), and Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition (Novo Tellus)—were also introduced by SGX. The three raised $520m during the month. All these three IPOs were subscribed seven to 36 times, which, according to GlobalData, reflects a strong investor sentiment.According to the GlobalData: ""SPAC is a quicker and more economical way for a company to go public. It is a shell company with no revenue-generating business and no prior operating history. It is necessary for a SPAC to announce the combination with a target operating company, referred to as a ‘de-SPAC’ transaction’, within 24 months of IPO listing and complete the transaction within 36 months.""“The emergence of SPAC IPOs in Singapore follows the implementation of new rules in September 2021 that enable blank-check companies to list on SGX’s mainboard. During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, blank-check companies (SPACs) remained one of the [favourite] forms of fundraising in the US. This also led to an increase in interest in SPACs in Asia, with Singapore and Hong Kong relaxing rules to allow blank-check companies to get listed on the mainboards of bourses,” said Keshav Kumar Jha, Business Fundamentals Analyst, GlobalData.",https://sbr.com.sg/stocks/in-focus/singapore-primed-be-new-hotspot-spac-ipos,2022-02-09T05:00:00+0800,"{'F13': 'Fu Yu', '586': 'Global Dragon', 'B73': 'Global Inv', 'AYN': 'Global Testing', 'H30': 'Hong Fok', 'BAZ': 'Lion Asiapac', '1G6': 'No Signboard', 'NTA': 'Novo Tellus SPAC', 'NTSW': 'Novo Tellus SPAC W291231', 'PGS': 'Pegasus SPAC', 'PGEW': 'Pegasus SPAC W291231', 'S68': 'SGX', 'DGRW': 'SGX 5xLongSG220630', 'DGSW': 'SGX 5xShortSG220630', 'DYKW': 'SGX 5xShortSG230420', 'AWE': 'SP Corp', 'PA3': 'TA', 'CGOW': 'TA W220520', 'VT1': 'Vertex SPAC', 'VT2W': 'Vertex SPAC W291231'}",,
